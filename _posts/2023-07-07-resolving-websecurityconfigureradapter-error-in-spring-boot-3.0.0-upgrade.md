## **Subheading: Identifying and Fixing WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter Error in Spring Boot 3.0.0**

Spring Boot 3.0.0 brings with it a host of new features and improvements that make it a worthy upgrade for any developer. However, the upgrade process isn't always smooth sailing. One of the common issues that developers encounter during this upgrade is the `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` error. This blog post aims to guide you through the process of identifying and resolving this error.

To begin with, it's important to understand why this error occurs. The `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` was a centerpiece of Spring Boot's security configuration in the past. However, with the release of Spring Boot 2.0, it was deprecated and completely removed in Spring Boot 3.0.0, leading to the error when old code tries to access it.

**Common Mistake 1: Using Deprecated Classes**

The first common mistake is simply using deprecated classes. If you're still using `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` in your code, you're bound to run into this error during the upgrade. The solution here is to remove all instances of `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` from your codebase and replace them with the new `SecurityFilterChain`.

**Common Mistake 2: Incomplete Refactoring**

The second common mistake is incomplete refactoring. In some cases, developers remove the `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` class but fail to replace it with the new `SecurityFilterChain`. This leads to the same error, as the system can't find an essential component of the security configuration.

Now, let's take a look at a code example that demonstrates these mistakes and their solutions. 

```javascript
// Old code
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.authorizeRequests().anyRequest().authenticated().and().formLogin().and().httpBasic();
    }
}
```

In the code snippet above, `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` is used to configure HTTP security. This is the code that would throw the `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` error in Spring Boot 3.0.0.

Now, let's refactor this code to use the new `SecurityFilterChain`.

```typescript
// New code
@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig {
    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        return http.authorizeRequests().anyRequest().authenticated().and().formLogin().and().httpBasic().securityFilterChain();
    }
}
```

In the refactored code, `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` is replaced with a `SecurityFilterChain` bean. This bean is then used to configure HTTP security, just like `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` was used in the old code.

This refactored code will not throw the `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` error when run on Spring Boot 3.0.0. However, it's important to note that this is just a basic example. The exact process of refactoring your code will depend on your specific use case and the complexity of your security configuration.

Remember, the key to a successful Spring Boot 3.0.0 upgrade is careful refactoring. Make sure to replace all instances of deprecated classes and to thoroughly test your code after the upgrade to ensure everything is working as expected. And don't forget to take advantage of the new features and improvements that Spring Boot 3.0.0 has to offer!

When you're working with Spring Boot and decide to upgrade to the latest version 3.0.0, you might encounter an error related to `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`. This error can be frustrating and may halt your progress. But don't worry, in this blog post, we are going to dissect this error and provide a step-by-step guide to resolving it.

## The Problem

The `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` was a centerpiece in previous versions of Spring Boot for handling security configurations. However, in Spring Boot 3.0.0, this class has been deprecated and removed, leading to the occurrence of the error.

## Understanding the Error

Before diving into the solution, let's understand the error message:

```javascript
Error: Cannot find symbol
Symbol: Class WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter
```

This error is thrown by the Java compiler when it encounters a symbol (in this case, `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`) that it doesn't recognize. Since the class has been removed in Spring Boot 3.0.0, the compiler can't find it, thus the error.

## The Solution

The solution to this problem is to replace the `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` with two other interfaces provided by Spring Security: `SecurityConfigurer` and `SecurityFilterChain`.

## Step 1: Remove WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter

Firstly, you need to remove the `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` from your code. This is the class causing the error, so it needs to go.

```javascript
// Remove this class
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
}
```

## Step 2: Implement SecurityConfigurer

Next, replace `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` with `SecurityConfigurer`. This interface provides the same functionality but is compatible with Spring Boot 3.0.0.

```javascript
// Replace with SecurityConfigurer
public class SecurityConfig implements SecurityConfigurer<SecurityFilterChain, HttpSecurity> {
}
```

## Step 3: Override configure method

After implementing the `SecurityConfigurer` interface, you need to override the `configure` method. This method is where you define your security configurations.

```javascript
@Override
public void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
        .authorizeRequests()
        .anyRequest().authenticated()
        .and()
        .httpBasic();
}
```

## Step 4: Implement SecurityFilterChain

In addition to `SecurityConfigurer`, you also need to implement the `SecurityFilterChain` interface. This interface is responsible for creating a `SecurityFilterChain` instance, which is used in the security configuration.

```javascript
@Bean
public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    return http
        .authorizeRequests()
        .anyRequest().authenticated()
        .and()
        .httpBasic()
        .and()
        .build();
}
```

## Wrapping Up

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` error in Spring Boot 3.0.0. The key is to replace the deprecated `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` with the `SecurityConfigurer` and `SecurityFilterChain` interfaces, and then override the `configure` method to define your security configurations.

Remember, every time you upgrade a library or framework, it's important to check the release notes and documentation for any breaking changes. This will save you from many headaches down the road.

Happy coding!
