## Subheading: Understanding and Addressing Common Errors in @EnableGlobalMethodSecurity Transition

As developers, we often encounter errors while transitioning from `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` in Spring Boot 3.0. This article aims to provide a comprehensive guide to understand and address these common errors, with a focus on practical examples and code-based explanations.

### Common Errors and their Causes

Let's first discuss the two most common errors that developers encounter during this transition.

1. **Error: Invalid Security Configuration**

   This error typically occurs when there is a mismatch between the security configurations in the `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` annotation and the actual method-level security requirements in your application.

2. **Error: Method Security Not Enforced**

   This error is encountered when the security constraints defined in the `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` annotation are not being enforced at the method level in your application.

Now, let's delve deeper into these errors, understand their causes, and discuss how to address them.

### Error 1: Invalid Security Configuration

The `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` annotation is used to enable method-level security within a Spring application. This annotation supports three types of security:

- `prePostEnabled`: for Spring's `@PreAuthorize` and `@PostAuthorize` annotations
- `securedEnabled`: for Spring's `@Secured` annotation
- `jsr250Enabled`: for JSR-250's `@RolesAllowed` annotation

If you're getting an "Invalid Security Configuration" error, it's likely because you've enabled a type of security that doesn't match the annotations used in your application.

For instance, consider the following JavaScript code:

```javascript
@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(securedEnabled = true)
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    // ...
}
```

In this example, `securedEnabled` is set to `true`, which means the application expects Spring's `@Secured` annotation to be used for method-level security. If you're using `@PreAuthorize` or `@RolesAllowed` in your application instead, you'll encounter the "Invalid Security Configuration" error.

### Error 2: Method Security Not Enforced

If you're facing the "Method Security Not Enforced" error, it's likely because the `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` annotation is not correctly placed in your application.

The `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` annotation should be placed on a `@Configuration` class that implements `SecurityConfigurerAdapter` or extends `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`.

For example, consider the following TypeScript code:

```typescript
@Configuration
@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    // ...
}
```

In this example, the `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` annotation is correctly placed on the `SecurityConfig` class that extends `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`. If the annotation is placed elsewhere in your application, the "Method Security Not Enforced" error will occur.

### Addressing the Errors

Now that we've understood the causes of these common errors, let's discuss how to address them.

#### Addressing Error 1: Invalid Security Configuration

To fix the "Invalid Security Configuration" error, ensure that the security type enabled in the `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` annotation matches the security annotations used in your application.

For instance, if your application uses the `@PreAuthorize` annotation, your `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` annotation should look like this:

```javascript
@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    // ...
}
```

#### Addressing Error 2: Method Security Not Enforced

To fix the "Method Security Not Enforced" error, ensure that the `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` annotation is placed on a `@Configuration` class that implements `SecurityConfigurerAdapter` or extends `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`.

For example:

```typescript
@Configuration
@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(securedEnabled = true)
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    // ...
}
```

By understanding these common errors and their solutions, you can smoothly transition from `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` in Spring Boot 3.0. Happy coding!

In this post, we will be discussing a common error encountered when transitioning from `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` in Spring Boot 3.0. This is a common issue faced by developers when they are upgrading their applications from Spring Boot 2.x to 3.0. The error typically appears when you try to enable global method security in your Spring Boot application.

## Understanding the Error

First, let's understand the error in detail. The `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` annotation is used to enable method-level security in a Spring Boot application. It allows you to control access to methods based on user roles. However, in Spring Boot 3.0, the `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` annotation has been deprecated.

The error usually occurs when you try to use `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` in a Spring Boot 3.0 application. The application fails to start, and you see an error message indicating that `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` is not recognized.

## Step-by-Step Solution

Now, let's look at a step-by-step solution to this error.

**Step 1:** Identify the Error

The first step is to identify the error. You can do this by checking the startup logs of your Spring Boot application. If you see an error message related to `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity`, you know that this is the issue you are facing.

**Step 2:** Understand the Cause

The error is caused by the deprecation of `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` in Spring Boot 3.0. This means that the annotation is no longer supported and cannot be used in your application.

**Step 3:** Replace `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity`

In Spring Boot 3.0, you should replace `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` with the new `@EnableMethodSecurity` annotation. This new annotation provides the same functionality but is compatible with Spring Boot 3.0.

Here is how you can do it in your Spring Security configuration:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    // ...
}
```

In the above code, we have replaced `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)` with `@EnableMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)`. The `prePostEnabled` attribute enables Spring Security pre/post annotations.

**Step 4:** Test Your Application

After making these changes, you should test your application to ensure that the error has been resolved. Start your application and check the startup logs. If you do not see any error messages related to `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity`, your application has successfully started.

**Step 5:** Verify the Functionality

The final step is to verify that method-level security is still working as expected. You can do this by testing the methods that are secured with Spring Security annotations. If you can access the methods with the correct roles and cannot access them with incorrect roles, method-level security is working correctly.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the transition from `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` to `@EnableMethodSecurity` in Spring Boot 3.0 can cause an error if not handled correctly. However, by understanding the cause of the error and following the steps outlined in this post, you can easily resolve this issue.

Remember, the key to resolving this error is to replace `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` with `@EnableMethodSecurity` in your Spring Security configuration. This change will ensure that your application is compatible with Spring Boot 3.0 and that method-level security is enabled.

Happy coding!
