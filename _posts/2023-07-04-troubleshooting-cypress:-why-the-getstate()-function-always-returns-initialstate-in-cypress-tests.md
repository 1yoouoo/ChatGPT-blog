In this blog post, we will delve deep into the world of Cypress, a popular end-to-end testing framework, and specifically, we will be discussing a common issue that developers face when using the `getState()` function. This function often returns the `initialState` in Cypress tests, which can be a source of frustration and confusion.

## **Understanding Cypress and the getState() Function**

Cypress is a powerful tool that allows developers to write and run end-to-end tests for web applications. The `getState()` function is a part of the Redux library, which is often used in conjunction with Cypress. It is used to access the current state in the Redux store. However, developers often encounter an issue where the `getState()` function returns the `initialState` instead of the current state.

## **Common Mistakes: Why is getState() Returning initialState?**

There are a couple of common mistakes that lead to this issue. The first is related to the asynchronous nature of JavaScript, and the second involves the incorrect usage of the Redux store.

**Mistake 1: Ignoring Asynchronous Nature of JavaScript**

In JavaScript, operations are often asynchronous. This means that they can start, run, and complete in the background while other parts of your code continue to execute. This is a fundamental aspect of JavaScript, and it can lead to unexpected results if not properly understood and handled.

Consider the following code:

```javascript
store.dispatch(someAction());
console.log(store.getState());
```

In this case, `someAction()` is dispatched to the Redux store, and immediately after, `getState()` is called. However, due to the asynchronous nature of JavaScript, there's a chance that `someAction()` may not have completed before `getState()` is called. As a result, `getState()` returns the `initialState`, as the state has not yet been updated.

**Mistake 2: Incorrect Usage of Redux Store**

The second common mistake involves the incorrect usage of the Redux store. In a typical Redux setup, the `initialState` is set when the store is created. However, if the store is not properly configured or if actions are not correctly dispatched, the `initialState` may not be updated as expected.

Consider the following code:

```javascript
const store = createStore(reducer, initialState);
store.dispatch(someAction());
console.log(store.getState());
```

In this case, if `someAction()` does not correctly update the state, `getState()` will return the `initialState`.

## **Understanding the Code: Deep Dive into the Errors**

Let's take a closer look at the code examples provided above to further understand why these errors occur.

In the first example, the issue arises due to the asynchronous nature of JavaScript. When `someAction()` is dispatched, it begins an operation that updates the state. However, because JavaScript is asynchronous, the `console.log(store.getState())` line may execute before `someAction()` has completed. As a result, `getState()` returns the state as it is at the moment of its call, which is the `initialState`.

In the second example, the problem is with the Redux store setup. If `someAction()` does not correctly update the state, then the state will remain as the `initialState`. This means that when `getState()` is called, it will return the `initialState` as it is the current state of the store.

## **Solutions: How to Correct These Mistakes**

To avoid these issues, it's important to understand the asynchronous nature of JavaScript and to correctly set up and use the Redux store.

For the first issue, you can use async/await to ensure that `someAction()` completes before calling `getState()`. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
async function updateStateAndLog() {
  await store.dispatch(someAction());
  console.log(store.getState());
}
updateStateAndLog();
```

For the second issue, you need to ensure that your actions are correctly updating the state. This often involves correctly setting up your reducers and ensuring that they are properly handling the dispatched actions.

```javascript
function reducer(state = initialState, action) {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'SOME_ACTION':
      return {...state, ...action.payload};
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
const store = createStore(reducer);
store.dispatch(someAction());
console.log(store.getState());
```

In this code, the reducer correctly handles `SOME_ACTION` and updates the state accordingly. As a result, when `getState()` is called, it returns the updated state instead of the `initialState`.

## **Final Thoughts**

Understanding the asynchronous nature of JavaScript and correctly using the Redux store are key to resolving the issue of `getState()` returning the `initialState` in Cypress tests. By avoiding the common mistakes discussed in this post and implementing the provided solutions, you can ensure that `getState()` correctly returns the current state, allowing you to write more reliable and effective tests.

If you've been working with **Cypress** for your end-to-end testing, you might have encountered a situation where the `getState()` function always returns the `initialState`. This can be quite frustrating, especially when your tests depend on the state of your application. In this post, we'll dive deep into this issue and provide a step-by-step guide on how to resolve it.

## Understanding the Problem

The problem arises when we try to access the state of our application during a test using the `getState()` function. Instead of returning the current state, it returns the `initialState`. This can be problematic because it means our tests are not reflecting the actual state of our application.

```javascript
// Example of the problem
cy.window().its('store').invoke('getState').then((state) => {
  expect(state).to.deep.equal(initialState); // This passes when it shouldn't
});
```

In the code snippet above, we're accessing the state of our application and expecting it to equal the `initialState`. This test passes, but it shouldn't if our state has changed.

## Why does this happen?

This issue arises due to how Cypress handles asynchronous operations. Cypress runs in a different event loop than your application. When you call `getState()`, Cypress retrieves the state at that exact moment. However, if there are any asynchronous actions that change the state, Cypress won't see those changes because it's in a different event loop.

## The Solution

To resolve this issue, we need to make sure that Cypress waits for all asynchronous actions to complete before it checks the state. We can achieve this by using the `cy.wait()` function. This function forces Cypress to wait for a specified amount of time or for a specific XHR request to complete.

```javascript
// Example of the solution
cy.window().its('store').invoke('getState').then((state) => {
  cy.wait(1000); // Wait for 1 second
  expect(state).to.not.deep.equal(initialState);
});
```

In the code snippet above, we're forcing Cypress to wait for 1 second before it checks the state. This gives enough time for any asynchronous actions to complete and for the state to update.

## A Better Solution

While the solution above works, it's not the best practice to use arbitrary wait times in your tests. A better solution would be to wait for a specific XHR request to complete.

```javascript
// Example of a better solution
cy.server();
cy.route('POST', '/api/changeState').as('changeState');

cy.window().its('store').invoke('getState').then((state) => {
  cy.wait('@changeState'); // Wait for the changeState request to complete
  expect(state).to.not.deep.equal(initialState);
});
```

In the code snippet above, we're using the `cy.route()` function to listen for a `POST` request to the `/api/changeState` endpoint. We then use the `cy.wait()` function to wait for this request to complete before we check the state.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the issue of `getState()` always returning the `initialState` in Cypress tests arises due to how Cypress handles asynchronous operations. By using the `cy.wait()` function, we can ensure that Cypress waits for all asynchronous actions to complete before it checks the state.

Remember, while using arbitrary wait times can solve the issue, it's better to wait for specific XHR requests to complete. This makes your tests more reliable and less prone to flakiness.

I hope this post has helped you understand and resolve this issue. Happy testing with Cypress!
