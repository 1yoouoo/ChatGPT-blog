When integrating the TikTok Login Kit into your web application, you may encounter the dreaded Redirect URI Error (Code 10006). This error can be quite a headache, but fear not! This guide will provide you with the necessary tools to troubleshoot and solve this issue.

## Understanding the Error

The Redirect URI Error (Code 10006) in TikTok Login Kit Web Flow typically arises due to a mismatch between the `redirect_uri` specified in your TikTok Developer Console and the actual `redirect_uri` in your application's code. This discrepancy results in TikTok's server refusing to redirect the user to the specified URI, thereby causing the error.

**Common Mistake #1: Incorrect URI in Developer Console**

One of the most common mistakes is specifying an incorrect `redirect_uri` in the TikTok Developer Console. This URI should match exactly with the `redirect_uri` in your application's code.

**Common Mistake #2: Not Updating the Redirect URI in the Code**

Another common mistake is forgetting to update the `redirect_uri` in your application's code after changing it in the TikTok Developer Console. This again leads to a mismatch and results in the error.

## The Code

To understand this better, let's look at a simple JavaScript example. Consider the following code snippet which initiates the TikTok Login Flow:

```javascript
TikTok.Auth.login({
    redirect_uri: 'https://yourwebsite.com/callback'
}).then(response => {
    console.log(response);
}).catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
});
```

In this case, the `redirect_uri` is set to 'https://yourwebsite.com/callback'. This URI should match exactly with the one specified in your TikTok Developer Console.

## Explaining the Code

The above code initiates the TikTok Login Flow when called. The `TikTok.Auth.login` method takes an options object as its parameter, which includes the `redirect_uri`. This URI is where TikTok will redirect the user after successful authentication.

The `then` method is used to handle the response from TikTok's server after successful authentication. The `catch` method, on the other hand, is used to handle any errors that occur during the login process.

## Troubleshooting Steps

To troubleshoot the Redirect URI Error (Code 10006), follow these steps:

1. **Check the `redirect_uri` in your TikTok Developer Console**: Ensure that the `redirect_uri` specified here matches exactly with the one in your application's code.

2. **Check the `redirect_uri` in your code**: Make sure that this URI matches with the one specified in your TikTok Developer Console. If not, update it to match.

3. **Test the Login Flow**: After ensuring that the URIs match, test the TikTok Login Flow again. If the error persists, there may be other issues at play.

## Other Possible Issues

If the error persists after following the troubleshooting steps, there may be other issues at play. One such issue could be a problem with the TikTok SDK itself. In such cases, it's best to check the official TikTok Developer Documentation or the SDK's GitHub page for any known issues or updates.

## Final Thoughts

The Redirect URI Error (Code 10006) in TikTok Login Kit Web Flow can be a frustrating issue to deal with. However, with a careful and methodical approach, it can be resolved. Remember to always double-check your URIs and keep your code and SDK up-to-date. Happy coding!

If you're a developer working with the **TikTok Login Kit Web Flow**, you may have come across an error code that has left you scratching your head - **Error Code 10006**. This error is related to the **Redirect URI**, and in this post, we'll delve into the details of this error and provide a step-by-step solution to resolve it.

## Understanding the Error

The **Redirect URI Error (Code 10006)** typically occurs when the redirect URI provided in your request does not match the one that you have configured in your application settings on the TikTok Developer platform. This mismatch results in the TikTok Login Kit Web Flow being unable to successfully authenticate your request, thereby throwing this error.

## Step-by-Step Solution

Let's walk through the solution to this error, step by step.

### Step 1: Check the Redirect URI in Your Request

The first step in resolving this error is to check the redirect URI that you're providing in your request. Here's an example of how you might be making the request in JavaScript:

```javascript
const tiktokAuthUrl = `https://open-api.tiktok.com/platform/oauth/connect?client_key=${clientKey}&response_type=code&redirect_uri=${redirectUri}&scope=user.info.basic&state=${state}`;
```

In this example, `redirectUri` is the redirect URI that you're providing in your request. Ensure that this URI is correct and is exactly the one that you want to use for your application.

### Step 2: Check the Redirect URI in Your Application Settings

Next, you need to check the redirect URI that you have configured in your application settings on the TikTok Developer platform. To do this, you need to log in to your TikTok Developer account, navigate to your application, and check the redirect URI in the settings.

### Step 3: Ensure the Redirect URIs Match

Once you have checked the redirect URI in your request and in your application settings, you need to ensure that these URIs match exactly. If they do not match, you will continue to encounter the Redirect URI Error (Code 10006).

### Step 4: Update the Redirect URI if Necessary

If the redirect URIs do not match, you need to update them so that they do. You can update the redirect URI in your request in your code, or you can update the redirect URI in your application settings on the TikTok Developer platform.

Here's how you might update the redirect URI in your request in JavaScript:

```javascript
const newRedirectUri = 'https://your-new-redirect-uri.com';
const tiktokAuthUrl = `https://open-api.tiktok.com/platform/oauth/connect?client_key=${clientKey}&response_type=code&redirect_uri=${newRedirectUri}&scope=user.info.basic&state=${state}`;
```

In this example, `newRedirectUri` is the new redirect URI that you want to use. Replace `'https://your-new-redirect-uri.com'` with your actual new redirect URI.

### Step 5: Test Your Request

Finally, after you have ensured that the redirect URIs match and have updated them if necessary, you should test your request to ensure that you no longer encounter the Redirect URI Error (Code 10006).

## Conclusion

The **Redirect URI Error (Code 10006)** in the TikTok Login Kit Web Flow can be a bit tricky to troubleshoot, but by carefully checking and ensuring that your redirect URIs match, you should be able to resolve this error. Remember, the key is in the details â€“ the redirect URIs need to match exactly for the authentication to be successful.

I hope this guide has been helpful in resolving your issues with the TikTok Login Kit Web Flow. Happy coding!
