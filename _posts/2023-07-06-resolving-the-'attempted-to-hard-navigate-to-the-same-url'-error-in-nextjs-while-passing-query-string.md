## Subheading: A Deep Dive into Debugging the 'Attempted to Hard Navigate to the Same URL' Error in NextJs

In the world of web development, encountering errors is a common phenomenon. One such error that NextJs developers often stumble upon is the 'Attempted to hard navigate to the same URL' error while passing a query string. This error can be a bit tricky to debug and resolve, but with the right approach, it can be managed efficiently. 

### **Understanding the Error**

Before we dive into resolving the error, it's essential to understand what the error means. The 'Attempted to hard navigate to the same URL' error in NextJs is typically triggered when you try to navigate to the same URL you are currently on, with a different query string. 

The main reason behind this error is that NextJs, by default, doesn't support hard navigation to the same URL, even if the query parameters are different. This can lead to confusion and frustration, especially when you are trying to implement a feature that requires such functionality.

### **Common Mistakes**

There are a couple of common mistakes that usually lead to this error. 

1. **Misunderstanding the Router**: The first one is a lack of understanding of how the NextJs Router works. In NextJs, the Router is designed to handle navigation within your application. However, it doesn't support hard navigation to the same URL by default. 

2. **Incorrect Use of Query Strings**: The second common mistake is the incorrect use of query strings. In NextJs, query strings are used to pass data between pages. However, if you try to navigate to the same URL with a different query string, it will trigger the 'Attempted to hard navigate to the same URL' error.

### **Code Example and Explanation**

Let's take a look at a simple example to understand this better.

```javascript
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'

export default function Page() {
  const router = useRouter()

  const handleClick = () => {
    router.push('/?key=value')
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Navigate
    </button>
  )
}
```

In the above code, we have a button that, when clicked, triggers the `handleClick` function. This function uses the `push` method of the NextJs `Router` to navigate to the same page with a query string `?key=value`. 

However, if you are already on the page with the URL `/?key=value`, clicking the button will trigger the 'Attempted to hard navigate to the same URL' error. This is because the `push` method is trying to navigate to the same URL you are currently on.

### **Resolving the Error**

Now that we understand the cause of the error, let's see how we can resolve it. 

The solution to this problem involves using the `replace` method of the NextJs `Router` instead of the `push` method. The `replace` method navigates to a different URL and replaces the current history entry.

Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'

export default function Page() {
  const router = useRouter()

  const handleClick = () => {
    router.replace('/?key=value')
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Navigate
    </button>
  )
}
```

In the updated code, the `replace` method navigates to the URL with the query string `?key=value` and replaces the current history entry. This way, even if you are already on the page with the URL `/?key=value`, clicking the button will not trigger the 'Attempted to hard navigate to the same URL' error.

Remember, understanding the error and the common mistakes that lead to it is the first step towards resolving it. With a clear understanding of how the NextJs `Router` works and how to correctly use query strings, you can avoid this error and build efficient NextJs applications.

If you're a developer working with NextJs, you might have come across the **'Attempted to Hard Navigate to the Same URL'** error while passing query string. This error can be quite annoying and might hinder your progress. But don't worry, we've got you covered. 

This error typically occurs when you're trying to navigate to the same URL you're currently on, with a different query string. NextJs sees this as a hard navigation and throws an error. The key to resolving this error lies in understanding how NextJs handles navigation and query strings.

Now, let's dive into the step-by-step solution to this error. 

**Step 1:** First, you need to understand the concept of **router in NextJs**. The router allows you to manipulate the URL and handle routing in your application. You can import the router using the following line of code:

```javascript
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'
```

**Step 2:** Next, let's say you have a function where you're trying to navigate to the same URL with a different query string, like so:

```javascript
const router = useRouter()
function navigate() {
  router.push('/same/url?query=newQuery')
}
```

This is where the error occurs. NextJs sees this as a hard navigation, as you're trying to navigate to the same URL.

**Step 3:** To resolve this error, you need to tell NextJs that this is not a hard navigation. You can do this by passing an additional argument to the `router.push()` method, like so:

```javascript
function navigate() {
  router.push('/same/url?query=newQuery', undefined, { shallow: true })
}
```

The `shallow: true` option tells NextJs to update the URL without running `getInitialProps`, `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps`. This effectively treats the navigation as a soft navigation, and NextJs will not throw the error.

**Step 4:** Now, if you run your function, you should not see the error anymore. However, note that with `shallow: true`, your page components will not re-render. If you need to perform some action when the query string changes, you can use the `useEffect` hook. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
import { useEffect } from 'react'

useEffect(() => {
  // Perform your action here
}, [router.query])
```

In the above code, the `useEffect` hook will run whenever the `router.query` changes. This allows you to perform actions when the query string changes, even with `shallow: true`.

**Step 5:** Finally, it's always a good practice to handle possible errors in your code. You can add a `try-catch` block in your function to handle any potential errors:

```javascript
function navigate() {
  try {
    router.push('/same/url?query=newQuery', undefined, { shallow: true })
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Navigation error:', error)
  }
}
```

In the above code, if an error occurs during navigation, it will be caught and logged to the console.

And that's how you can resolve the 'Attempted to Hard Navigate to the Same URL' error in NextJs while passing query string. Remember, understanding how NextJs handles navigation and query strings is key to resolving this error.
