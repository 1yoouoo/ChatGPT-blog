## Understanding the 'Unsupported Class File Major Version 64' Error

The 'Unsupported Class File Major Version 64' error is a common issue faced by developers when working with Spring Initializr projects. It typically indicates a **compatibility issue** between the version of Java used to compile the project and the version of Java used to run it.

## Why do we encounter this error?

There are two main reasons why you might be encountering this error:

1. **Mismatch between compile-time and runtime Java versions**: This is the most common cause. If your project is compiled using a newer version of Java but run using an older version, you will encounter this error. This is because newer versions of Java often introduce features that are not supported in older versions.

2. **Incorrect Java version specified in project settings**: If you've specified a particular Java version in your project settings (such as in your `pom.xml` for Maven projects or `build.gradle` for Gradle projects), but you're not using that version of Java on your system, you will encounter this error.

## How to resolve this error?

To resolve this error, we need to ensure that the **same version of Java is used both at compile-time and runtime**. Here's how you can do this:

### Step 1: Check your Java version

First, check the version of Java that you're using on your system. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```javascript
java -version
```

### Step 2: Update your project settings

Next, update your project settings to use the same version of Java. If you're using Maven, you can specify the Java version in your `pom.xml` file as follows:

```xml
<properties>
    <java.version>1.8</java.version>
</properties>
```

If you're using Gradle, you can specify the Java version in your `build.gradle` file as follows:

```groovy
sourceCompatibility = 1.8
targetCompatibility = 1.8
```

In the above examples, replace `1.8` with the version of Java that you're using on your system.

### Step 3: Recompile your project

Finally, recompile your project. If you're using Maven, you can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

If you're using Gradle, you can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
gradle clean build
```

## Understanding the code

Let's take a closer look at the code. The `java -version` command checks the version of Java that you're using on your system. The `<java.version>1.8</java.version>` line in the `pom.xml` file (or the `sourceCompatibility = 1.8` line in the `build.gradle` file) specifies the version of Java that should be used to compile the project. The `mvn clean install` command (or the `gradle clean build` command) recompiles the project.

By ensuring that the **same version of Java is used both at compile-time and runtime**, we can resolve the 'Unsupported Class File Major Version 64' error. 

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the 'Unsupported Class File Major Version 64' error is a common issue faced by developers when working with Spring Initializr projects. It typically indicates a compatibility issue between the version of Java used to compile the project and the version of Java used to run it. By ensuring that the same version of Java is used both at compile-time and runtime, we can resolve this error.

If you're a developer, you've probably come across the **'Unsupported Class File Major Version 64'** error in your Spring Initializr project. This error can be quite frustrating, especially if you're in the middle of a project and everything comes to a standstill. But don't worry, we've got you covered. In this blog post, we'll explain in detail how to resolve this error so you can get back to coding in no time.

## Understanding the Error

First, let's take a moment to understand what this error means. The **Unsupported Class File Major Version 64** error typically occurs when the Java compiler version used to compile the project is not compatible with the Java version used to run the application. This error is common when you're using a newer version of Java to compile your project but running the application on an older Java version.

## Step 1: Check Your Java Version

The first step in resolving this error is to check the version of Java you're using. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```javascript
java -version
```

This command will display the Java version you're currently using. Make sure to note this down as we'll need it in the next steps.

## Step 2: Check Your Project's Java Version

Next, you need to check the Java version used in your Spring Initializr project. This can be found in the `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file, depending on whether you're using Maven or Gradle. Look for the `java.version` property and compare it with the version you noted down in the previous step.

```typescript
<properties>
  <java.version>1.8</java.version>
</properties>
```

If the versions don't match, this is likely the cause of the error.

## Step 3: Update Your Java Version

If the versions don't match, you'll need to update the Java version in your project to match the version you're using to run the application. To do this, simply change the `java.version` property in your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file to match the version you noted down in step 1.

```typescript
<properties>
  <java.version>1.8</java.version> <!-- Change this to match your Java version -->
</properties>
```

After updating the Java version, clean and rebuild your project. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```javascript
mvn clean install
```

This command will clean your project and rebuild it using the updated Java version.

## Step 4: Verify the Solution

After rebuilding your project, try running your application again. If everything was done correctly, the **Unsupported Class File Major Version 64** error should no longer appear.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the **Unsupported Class File Major Version 64** error in Spring Initializr projects is typically caused by a mismatch between the Java version used to compile the project and the Java version used to run the application. By checking and updating your Java version, you can easily resolve this error and get back to coding.

Remember, it's always important to keep your Java version updated to avoid such errors in the future. Happy coding!
