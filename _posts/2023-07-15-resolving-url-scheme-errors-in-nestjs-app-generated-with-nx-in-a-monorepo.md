## **Understanding the Issue**

When working with a monorepo and NestJS, developers often encounter URL scheme errors. These errors typically occur when the application is unable to correctly interpret the URL scheme. This can be due to a variety of reasons such as incorrect configuration, incompatible versions of dependencies, or simply a bug in the code. 

## **Common Mistakes Leading to URL Scheme Errors**

### **Incorrect Configuration**

One of the most common mistakes leading to URL scheme errors in a NestJS app generated with NX in a monorepo is incorrect configuration. This could be an incorrect setup of the router module, improper setting of base URLs, or misconfiguration of the environment variables. 

For instance, consider the following TypeScript code snippet:

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { RouterModule } from 'nest-router';

@Module({
  imports: [
    RouterModule.forRoutes([
      { path: '/api', module: AppModule },
    ]),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```
In this example, the '/api' base URL is incorrectly set. This could lead to URL scheme errors when the application tries to route to '/api'.

### **Incompatible Versions of Dependencies**

Another common mistake is using incompatible versions of dependencies. For instance, if your application is using an older version of NestJS but a newer version of NX, this could lead to compatibility issues and result in URL scheme errors. 

Consider the following `package.json` file:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@nestjs/common": "^6.0.0",
    "@nrwl/nx": "^10.0.0"
  }
}
```
In this example, the application is using NestJS version 6 and NX version 10. Given the major version difference, this could potentially lead to compatibility issues resulting in URL scheme errors.

## **Debugging and Fixing the Issue**

To resolve these issues, it's important to first understand the root cause. Start by checking the error message. NestJS provides detailed error messages that can help you pinpoint the exact issue. 

Once you've identified the issue, you can start debugging. If the issue is due to incorrect configuration, you'll need to correct the configuration. For example, if the base URL is incorrectly set, you'll need to correct it:

```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { RouterModule } from 'nest-router';

@Module({
  imports: [
    RouterModule.forRoutes([
      { path: '/api/v1', module: AppModule },
    ]),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```
In this corrected code snippet, the base URL is set to '/api/v1', which is the correct configuration.

If the issue is due to incompatible versions of dependencies, you'll need to update your dependencies to compatible versions. For example, if you're using NestJS version 6 and NX version 10, you might need to update NestJS to a compatible version:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@nestjs/common": "^7.0.0",
    "@nrwl/nx": "^10.0.0"
  }
}
```
In this updated `package.json` file, the application is now using NestJS version 7, which is compatible with NX version 10.

## **Preventing Future URL Scheme Errors**

To prevent future URL scheme errors, it's important to follow best practices when configuring your NestJS app and managing dependencies in a monorepo. Always ensure that your base URLs are correctly set and that your dependencies are compatible with each other.

Additionally, consider using tools like NX's dependency graph to visualize and manage your dependencies. This can help you spot potential issues before they lead to errors.

By understanding the common mistakes that lead to URL scheme errors and how to debug them, you can ensure that your NestJS app runs smoothly in a monorepo environment.

When working with a monorepo setup in a NestJS app, one common issue that developers often encounter is related to URL scheme errors. This issue becomes increasingly problematic when the application is generated with NX. In this blog post, we are going to delve into the details of this error and provide a comprehensive step-by-step guide to resolving it.

## Understanding the Error

The URL scheme error typically arises when the application is unable to correctly interpret the specified URL scheme. This can occur due to a variety of reasons, including incorrect configuration, syntax errors, or compatibility issues with the NX monorepo setup.

## Step 1: Identifying the Error

The first step in resolving any error is to accurately identify it. In our case, the URL scheme error will usually manifest itself in the form of a console error message. This error message will typically include the faulty URL and a brief description of the issue. 

## Step 2: Inspecting the URL Scheme

Once you've identified the error, the next step is to inspect the URL scheme that's causing the problem. In a NestJS app, the URL scheme is usually defined in the `app.module.ts` file. Here's an example of how a typical URL scheme might look:

```typescript
@Module({
  imports: [
    ConfigModule.forRoot(),
    TypeOrmModule.forRoot({
      type: 'postgres',
      host: process.env.POSTGRES_HOST,
      port: +process.env.POSTGRES_PORT,
      username: process.env.POSTGRES_USER,
      password: process.env.POSTGRES_PASSWORD,
      database: process.env.POSTGRES_DB,
      entities: [__dirname + '/**/*.entity{.ts,.js}'],
      synchronize: true,
    }),
  ],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

In this example, we're using the `TypeOrmModule.forRoot()` method to define our URL scheme. The parameters for this method are passed in as an object, which includes the type of database we're using (`postgres`), the host, port, username, password, and database name, as well as the entities path.

## Step 3: Checking the Configuration

The next step in resolving the URL scheme error is to check your configuration. This involves ensuring that all the parameters passed to the `TypeOrmModule.forRoot()` method are correct and valid. 

## Step 4: Debugging the Issue

If your configuration seems to be in order but you're still encountering the error, it's time to start debugging. One effective way to debug this issue is by using the `console.log()` method to print out the values of your configuration parameters. 

```typescript
console.log(process.env.POSTGRES_HOST);
console.log(process.env.POSTGRES_PORT);
console.log(process.env.POSTGRES_USER);
console.log(process.env.POSTGRES_PASSWORD);
console.log(process.env.POSTGRES_DB);
```

By doing this, you can verify whether the correct values are being passed to the `TypeOrmModule.forRoot()` method. If any of the values are incorrect or undefined, this might be the root cause of your URL scheme error.

## Step 5: Resolving Compatibility Issues

In some cases, the URL scheme error might be caused by compatibility issues with the NX monorepo setup. If this is the case, you'll need to ensure that all your dependencies are up to date and compatible with each other. 

## Step 6: Updating Your Dependencies

To update your dependencies, you can use the `npm update` or `yarn upgrade` command. This will update all your dependencies to their latest versions, which might resolve any compatibility issues you're facing.

## Step 7: Rebuilding Your App

After updating your dependencies, you should rebuild your app to ensure that all the changes are properly integrated. You can do this by using the `npm run build` or `yarn build` command.

## Step 8: Testing Your App

The final step in resolving the URL scheme error is to test your app. This involves running your app and checking whether the error still persists. If the error is resolved, congratulations! If not, you might need to revisit the previous steps and check whether you've missed anything.

## Conclusion

Resolving URL scheme errors in a NestJS app generated with NX in a monorepo can be a challenging task, but with a systematic approach and a thorough understanding of your app's configuration, it's definitely achievable. Remember, the key to resolving any error is to stay patient, remain persistent, and keep debugging until you find the solution. Happy coding!
