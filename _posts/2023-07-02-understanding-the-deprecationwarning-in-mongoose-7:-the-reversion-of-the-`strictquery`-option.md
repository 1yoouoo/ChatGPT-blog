## Subheading: Navigating the DeprecationWarning in Mongoose 7: Diving Deep into the `strictQuery` Option Reversion

Mongoose, a popular Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, has a history of constant evolution and refinement. With the recent release of Mongoose 7, developers have been facing a new challenge: a **DeprecationWarning** related to the reversion of the `strictQuery` option. This article aims to shed light on this warning and provide comprehensive insights into why it occurs and how to navigate it.

The `strictQuery` option in Mongoose is designed to prevent developers from querying fields that do not exist in the schema. However, in Mongoose 7, this option has been deprecated and reverted, leading to the DeprecationWarning.

### **Common Mistake 1: Ignoring Schema Design**

The first common mistake that leads to this warning is **ignoring schema design**. Mongoose heavily relies on schemas to understand the structure of the data it's working with. If you query a field that is not defined in your schema, Mongoose will throw a DeprecationWarning. Here's an example:

```javascript
const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  email: String
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);

User.find({ age: { $gte: 21 } });  // This will throw a DeprecationWarning
```

In the above example, we are trying to find all users who are 21 years or older. However, our UserSchema does not define an `age` field, leading to the warning.

### **Common Mistake 2: Not Updating Query Logic After Schema Changes**

The second common mistake is **not updating the query logic after schema changes**. If you update your schema by removing or renaming a field, you need to ensure that all queries referencing that field are also updated. Failure to do this will lead to a DeprecationWarning. Here's an example:

```javascript
const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  email: String,
  dateOfBirth: Date
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);

User.find({ age: { $gte: 21 } });  // This will throw a DeprecationWarning
```

In this example, we've updated our UserSchema to use a `dateOfBirth` field instead of `age`. However, our query is still trying to find users based on the `age` field, which no longer exists in the schema.

### **Understanding the `strictQuery` Option**

The `strictQuery` option, when set to `true`, tells Mongoose to only allow queries on fields that exist in the schema. When set to `false`, Mongoose will allow queries on any field, regardless of whether it exists in the schema or not.

In Mongoose 7, this option has been deprecated and reverted, meaning that the default behavior is now to allow queries on any field. This change was made to better align Mongoose with MongoDB's behavior, which allows queries on any field by default.

```javascript
const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  email: String
}, { strictQuery: false });

const User = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);

User.find({ age: { $gte: 21 } });  // This will not throw a DeprecationWarning
```

In the above example, even though `age` is not defined in our UserSchema, Mongoose does not throw a DeprecationWarning because we've set `strictQuery` to `false`.

### **Navigating the DeprecationWarning**

While the reversion of the `strictQuery` option may initially seem like a hindrance, it is important to understand that it is a step towards aligning Mongoose more closely with MongoDB's behavior. By understanding the reasons behind this warning and adapting our code accordingly, we can ensure that our applications continue to function as expected.

Remember, the key to avoiding these warnings lies in a well-defined schema and careful query logic. Always ensure that your queries align with your schema, and update your query logic whenever your schema changes. By doing so, you can avoid unnecessary warnings and ensure that your application runs smoothly.

If you're a developer who uses MongoDB with Mongoose, you may have encountered a **DeprecationWarning** concerning the `strictQuery` option. This warning typically reads: "DeprecationWarning: the `strictQuery` option is reverting back to false (its MongoDB shell default) in mongoose 7.x" 

## What does this mean?

The `strictQuery` option in Mongoose is used to determine how the library handles undefined values in queries. When `strictQuery` is set to `true`, Mongoose will filter out undefined values in queries. Conversely, when `strictQuery` is set to `false`, Mongoose will not filter out undefined values.

This warning is being thrown because, in Mongoose 7, the `strictQuery` option is being reverted back to `false`. This is a *significant* change, as it alters the behavior of all queries in your application.

## Why should you care?

If your application relies on the `strictQuery` option being set to `true`, this change could potentially break your application. It's crucial to understand this change and update your code accordingly.

## How to resolve this warning?

Resolving this warning is a *two-step process*.

### Step 1: Identify the affected queries

First, identify all the queries in your application that rely on the `strictQuery` option being set to `true`. This can be a tedious task, but it's necessary to ensure your application continues to work as expected.

Here's a simple example of a query that could be affected by this change:

```javascript
const results = await MyModel.find({ name: undefined });
```

In Mongoose 6 and earlier, if `strictQuery` is set to `true`, this query would be equivalent to `MyModel.find({})`, because the `name: undefined` part would be stripped out. However, in Mongoose 7, if `strictQuery` is set to `false`, the query would be equivalent to `MyModel.find({ name: { $eq: undefined } })`.

### Step 2: Update your queries

Once you've identified the affected queries, the next step is to update them. This typically involves replacing `undefined` values with the `$exists` operator.

Here's how you can update the previous example:

```javascript
const results = await MyModel.find({ name: { $exists: true } });
```

This query is equivalent to the original query when `strictQuery` is set to `true`.

## Conclusion

The reversion of the `strictQuery` option in Mongoose 7 is a significant change that could potentially break your application if not handled properly. By understanding this change and updating your code accordingly, you can ensure your application continues to work as expected.

Remember, the key to resolving this warning is to *identify the affected queries* and *update them* accordingly. It may be a tedious task, but it's a necessary one to ensure the stability of your application.

Happy coding!
