## **Subheading: Understanding and Implementing Authorization in NestJS with isAuthor Guard**

NestJS, a progressive Node.js framework, offers a robust set of tools for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. One such tool is the *Guard*, a specific type of middleware that determines whether a request should be handled by the route handler or not.

In this guide, we will delve deep into the creation of an `isAuthor` Guard, a common requirement in many NestJS applications where certain actions should only be performed by the author of the resource.

## **Common Mistakes and Errors**

Before diving into the creation and implementation, let's discuss two common mistakes that developers often encounter when working with Guards in NestJS.

1. **Incorrect Guard Implementation**: A common mistake is not correctly implementing the `canActivate` method, which is the heart of any Guard. It should return `true` if the request is allowed, and `false` otherwise. 

2. **Misunderstanding of Guard Execution Order**: Another common error is misunderstanding the order in which Guards are executed. Guards are executed after each Middleware, but before any Interceptor or Pipe. This execution order is crucial to remember when structuring your application.

## **Creating the isAuthor Guard**

Let's start building our `isAuthor` Guard. In NestJS, Guards are classes annotated with the `@Injectable()` decorator, and they should implement the `CanActivate` interface.

```typescript
import { Injectable, CanActivate, ExecutionContext } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class IsAuthorGuard implements CanActivate {
  canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): boolean {
    // Implementation goes here
  }
}
```

In the `canActivate` method, we will implement the logic to check if the user making the request is the author of the resource. 

## **Understanding the ExecutionContext**

The `ExecutionContext` is a wrapper around the arguments of the method that is currently being processed. It provides methods to easily access the `Request` and `Response` objects, the current `User` object, and other useful information.

```typescript
const user = context.switchToHttp().getRequest().user;
const resource = context.switchToHttp().getRequest().resource;
```

In the code above, we are extracting the `user` and `resource` from the `request` object. 

## **Implementing the isAuthor Check**

Now, let's implement the logic to check if the user is the author of the resource. 

```typescript
canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): boolean {
  const user = context.switchToHttp().getRequest().user;
  const resource = context.switchToHttp().getRequest().resource;

  return user.id === resource.authorId;
}
```

In this code, we are simply comparing the `id` of the `user` with the `authorId` of the `resource`. If they match, the user is the author, and the method returns `true`, allowing the request to be processed further.

## **Using the isAuthor Guard**

To use the `isAuthor` Guard, we need to bind it to a route handler using the `@UseGuards()` decorator.

```typescript
import { Controller, UseGuards, Post } from '@nestjs/common';
import { IsAuthorGuard } from './isAuthor.guard';

@Controller('resources')
export class ResourcesController {
  @Post()
  @UseGuards(IsAuthorGuard)
  create() {
    // Handler code goes here
  }
}
```

In this code, we are binding the `isAuthor` Guard to the `create` method of the `ResourcesController`. Now, every time a POST request is made to the `/resources` endpoint, the `isAuthor` Guard will be executed before the `create` method.

## **Testing the isAuthor Guard**

To test the `isAuthor` Guard, we can create a test suite using Jest, the testing framework recommended by NestJS.

```typescript
import { ExecutionContext } from '@nestjs/common';
import { IsAuthorGuard } from './isAuthor.guard';

describe('IsAuthorGuard', () => {
  let guard: IsAuthorGuard;

  beforeEach(() => {
    guard = new IsAuthorGuard();
  });

  it('should allow if user is the author', () => {
    const context = {
      switchToHttp: () => ({
        getRequest: () => ({
          user: { id: 1 },
          resource: { authorId: 1 },
        }),
      }),
    } as unknown as ExecutionContext;

    expect(guard.canActivate(context)).toBe(true);
  });

  it('should deny if user is not the author', () => {
    const context = {
      switchToHttp: () => ({
        getRequest: () => ({
          user: { id: 1 },
          resource: { authorId: 2 },
        }),
      }),
    } as unknown as ExecutionContext;

    expect(guard.canActivate(context)).toBe(false);
  });
});
```

In this test suite, we are testing the `isAuthor` Guard with two different scenarios. In the first test, the user is the author of the resource, and in the second test, they are not.

In the world of NestJS, it's essential to understand the concept of **_guards_**. They are a powerful tool that can help you manage access control in your application, ensuring that only authorized users can perform certain actions. However, when not implemented correctly, they can lead to the dreaded `isAuthor` error. This post aims to provide a comprehensive guide on how to create an `isAuthor` guard in NestJS, thereby resolving the `isAuthor` error.

## Step 1: Understanding the `isAuthor` Error

Before we dive into the solution, let's first understand what the `isAuthor` error is. 

```typescript
throw new UnauthorizedException('You are not the author of this post');
```

This error typically occurs when a user tries to perform an action they are not authorized to do. For instance, if a user tries to edit a post they didn't create, the `isAuthor` guard should prevent them from doing so. If it doesn't, you might encounter the `isAuthor` error.

## Step 2: Creating the `isAuthor` Guard

To create the `isAuthor` guard, we'll use the `@nestjs/common` and `@nestjs/passport` packages. 

```typescript
import { CanActivate, ExecutionContext, Injectable, UnauthorizedException } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AuthGuard } from '@nestjs/passport';

@Injectable()
export class IsAuthorGuard extends AuthGuard('jwt') {
  canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): boolean {
    const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();
    const user = request.user;
    const post = request.post;

    if (user.id !== post.authorId) {
      throw new UnauthorizedException('You are not the author of this post');
    }

    return true;
  }
}
```
In the code above, we're extending the `AuthGuard` class and overriding the `canActivate` method. This method is where we determine if the current user is the author of the post they're trying to manipulate.

## Step 3: Implementing the `isAuthor` Guard

To implement the `isAuthor` guard, we need to apply it to the route handlers where we want to enforce the authorship rule. 

```typescript
import { Controller, UseGuards, Put, Param } from '@nestjs/common';
import { IsAuthorGuard } from './is-author.guard';

@Controller('posts')
export class PostsController {
  @UseGuards(IsAuthorGuard)
  @Put(':id')
  updatePost(@Param('id') id: string) {
    // update post logic here
  }
}
```
In the code snippet above, we're applying the `IsAuthorGuard` to the `updatePost` method, which means that only the author of the post can update it.

## Step 4: Testing the `isAuthor` Guard

To ensure that our `isAuthor` guard is working as expected, we need to test it. 

```typescript
import { Test } from '@nestjs/testing';
import { UnauthorizedException } from '@nestjs/common';
import { IsAuthorGuard } from './is-author.guard';

describe('IsAuthorGuard', () => {
  let guard: IsAuthorGuard;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    const module = await Test.createTestingModule({
      providers: [IsAuthorGuard],
    }).compile();

    guard = module.get<IsAuthorGuard>(IsAuthorGuard);
  });

  it('should throw UnauthorizedException if user is not the author', () => {
    const context = {
      switchToHttp: () => ({
        getRequest: () => ({
          user: { id: 1 },
          post: { authorId: 2 },
        }),
      }),
    };
    expect(() => guard.canActivate(context as any)).toThrow(UnauthorizedException);
  });

  it('should return true if user is the author', () => {
    const context = {
      switchToHttp: () => ({
        getRequest: () => ({
          user: { id: 1 },
          post: { authorId: 1 },
        }),
      }),
    };
    expect(guard.canActivate(context as any)).toBe(true);
  });
});
```
In the test above, we're simulating two scenarios: one where the user is not the author of the post, and one where they are. If the guard is implemented correctly, it should throw an `UnauthorizedException` in the first scenario and return `true` in the second.

## Conclusion

Creating an `isAuthor` guard in NestJS can be a bit tricky, but with a clear understanding of how guards work and the steps outlined in this guide, you should be able to implement it successfully and avoid the `isAuthor` error. Remember to always test your guards to ensure they're working as expected. Happy coding!
