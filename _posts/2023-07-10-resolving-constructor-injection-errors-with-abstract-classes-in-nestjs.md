### Unraveling the Mystery of Constructor Injection Errors

In the world of NestJS, one of the most common challenges developers face is dealing with constructor injection errors related to abstract classes. These errors are often confusing and can lead to a lot of frustration if not addressed correctly. In this blog post, we'll be dissecting this problem and providing practical solutions to help you navigate through these errors.

### Understanding the Problem

The crux of the issue lies in how NestJS handles dependency injection. NestJS uses TypeScript metadata reflection system to resolve dependencies. However, when dealing with abstract classes, the metadata for the constructor parameters is not always correctly resolved, leading to the infamous `Nest can't resolve dependencies` error.

### Mistake 1: Injecting Abstract Classes Directly

One of the most common mistakes developers make is trying to inject abstract classes directly. This is a problem because abstract classes cannot be instantiated, and therefore, cannot be injected. 

```typescript
abstract class AbstractClass {
    abstract doSomething(): void;
}

@Injectable()
class ConcreteClass {
    constructor(private readonly abstractClass: AbstractClass) {}
}
```

In the above example, when NestJS tries to resolve the dependencies of `ConcreteClass`, it will fail because it can't instantiate `AbstractClass`.

### Mistake 2: Not Providing a Concrete Implementation

Another common mistake is not providing a concrete implementation for the abstract class. Even if you're using `@Inject()` decorator to inject the abstract class, you still need to provide a concrete implementation of the abstract class.

```typescript
abstract class AbstractClass {
    abstract doSomething(): void;
}

@Injectable()
class ConcreteClass implements AbstractClass {
    doSomething(): void {
        console.log('Doing something...');
    }
}

@Module({
    providers: [
        { provide: AbstractClass, useClass: ConcreteClass }
    ]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

In this example, we're providing a concrete implementation of `AbstractClass` using `useClass` provider. Now, when NestJS tries to resolve the dependencies, it will instantiate `ConcreteClass` instead of `AbstractClass`.

### Solution: Using @Inject() Decorator and useClass Provider

The solution to these constructor injection errors is to use `@Inject()` decorator and `useClass` provider together. `@Inject()` decorator tells NestJS to inject a dependency, and `useClass` provider tells NestJS what concrete implementation to use for the abstract class.

```typescript
abstract class AbstractClass {
    abstract doSomething(): void;
}

@Injectable()
class ConcreteClass implements AbstractClass {
    doSomething(): void {
        console.log('Doing something...');
    }
}

@Injectable()
class SomeService {
    constructor(@Inject(AbstractClass) private readonly abstractClass: AbstractClass) {}
}

@Module({
    providers: [
        SomeService,
        { provide: AbstractClass, useClass: ConcreteClass }
    ]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

In this example, we're injecting `AbstractClass` into `SomeService` using `@Inject()` decorator. Then, we're telling NestJS to use `ConcreteClass` as the concrete implementation of `AbstractClass` using `useClass` provider.

### Breaking Down the Code

Let's break down the code to understand it better. First, we have an abstract class `AbstractClass` with an abstract method `doSomething()`. Then, we have a concrete class `ConcreteClass` that implements `AbstractClass` and provides an implementation for `doSomething()` method.

Next, we have a service `SomeService` that has a dependency on `AbstractClass`. We're injecting this dependency using `@Inject()` decorator. This tells NestJS to inject a dependency, but it doesn't tell NestJS what to inject. That's where `useClass` provider comes in.

In the `@Module()` decorator, we're providing a list of providers. One of these providers is `{ provide: AbstractClass, useClass: ConcreteClass }`. This tells NestJS to use `ConcreteClass` as the concrete implementation of `AbstractClass`. Now, when NestJS tries to resolve the dependencies of `SomeService`, it will inject an instance of `ConcreteClass` instead of `AbstractClass`.

### Conclusion

By understanding the underlying problem and avoiding common mistakes, you can effectively resolve constructor injection errors with abstract classes in NestJS. Remember, when dealing with abstract classes, always provide a concrete implementation and use `@Inject()` decorator and `useClass` provider together. Happy coding!

In this blog post, we will be discussing a common error that developers encounter while working with NestJS - **Constructor Injection Errors with Abstract Classes**. This error typically occurs when you are trying to inject an abstract class into a constructor in NestJS. 

To give you a bit of context, **Dependency Injection** is a fundamental aspect of the NestJS framework. It is a technique where an object receives other objects that it depends on. In NestJS, we usually achieve this by injecting dependencies through a class constructor. However, when working with abstract classes, this can lead to some issues.

## The Problem

Let's consider a typical scenario where you might encounter this error. Suppose you have an abstract class - `AbstractService` and a concrete class - `ConcreteService` that extends `AbstractService`. You are trying to inject `AbstractService` into the constructor of a controller class.

```typescript
abstract class AbstractService {
  abstract doSomething(): void;
}

class ConcreteService extends AbstractService {
  doSomething() {
    console.log('Doing something');
  }
}

@Controller('api')
export class ApiController {
  constructor(private readonly abstractService: AbstractService) {}
}
```

When you run your NestJS application, you encounter an error - `Nest can't resolve dependencies of the ApiController (?). Please make sure that the argument AbstractService at index [0] is available in the current context.`

This error message indicates that NestJS is unable to resolve the `AbstractService` dependency in the `ApiController` constructor. This is because, in NestJS, you cannot directly inject an abstract class into a constructor. 

## The Solution

Now, let's dive into how to resolve this error. The solution involves two steps:

### Step 1: Create a Custom Provider

Firstly, you need to create a custom provider for your abstract class. A provider is essentially a recipe for creating a service. In NestJS, you can create a custom provider using the `provide` and `useClass` properties.

```typescript
{
  provide: AbstractService,
  useClass: ConcreteService,
}
```

In this code snippet, we are creating a custom provider that tells NestJS to return an instance of `ConcreteService` whenever `AbstractService` is requested.

### Step 2: Register the Custom Provider

Next, you need to register your custom provider in the appropriate module. You do this by adding your custom provider to the `providers` array in your module.

```typescript
@Module({
  providers: [
    {
      provide: AbstractService,
      useClass: ConcreteService,
    },
  ],
  controllers: [ApiController],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Now, whenever `AbstractService` is requested, NestJS will return an instance of `ConcreteService`. This means that you can now inject `AbstractService` into your `ApiController` constructor without any issues.

## Conclusion

To wrap up, constructor injection errors with abstract classes in NestJS occur because you cannot directly inject an abstract class into a constructor. However, you can resolve this error by creating and registering a custom provider for your abstract class.

Remember, the key to resolving this error lies in understanding how Dependency Injection works in NestJS. Once you grasp this concept, you will be able to resolve not only this error but also many other similar errors that you might encounter while working with NestJS.
