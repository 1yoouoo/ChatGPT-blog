## Understanding the 302 Status Error

The **302 status error** is a common HTTP response status code that indicates that the requested resource has been temporarily moved to a new URL. This error often occurs when the server is configured to redirect a client's request to a different location.

### Common Mistake 1: Incorrect Redirection URL

One of the most common mistakes that lead to a 302 status error is specifying an incorrect redirection URL. If the URL you're redirecting to doesn't exist or is unreachable, the server will be unable to complete the redirection and will return a 302 status error.

### Common Mistake 2: Infinite Redirection Loop

Another common mistake is creating an infinite redirection loop. This happens when the redirection URL leads back to the original URL, causing the server to constantly attempt to redirect the client's request.

## Using RTK Query to Manage 302 Status Errors

**RTK Query** is a powerful tool that can help manage and resolve 302 status errors. It is a library that provides developers with a set of utilities for simplifying data fetching and state management in Redux applications.

Let's see an example of how you can use RTK Query to handle a 302 status error:

```javascript
import { createApi, fetchBaseQuery } from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react'

const api = createApi({
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({ baseUrl: '/api' }),
  endpoints: (builder) => ({
    getPost: builder.query({
      query: (id) => `post/${id}`,
      providesTags: (result, error, id) => [{ type: 'Post', id }],
    }),
  }),
})

export const { useGetPostQuery } = api
```

In the code above, we're creating an API slice using `createApi`. We're setting the `baseUrl` to '/api' and defining a single endpoint `getPost`. If the server returns a 302 status error when we try to fetch a post, RTK Query will automatically retry the request.

## How RTK Query Handles Redirection

RTK Query uses the Fetch API under the hood, which follows redirects by default. This means that if the server returns a 302 status error and provides a new URL in the `Location` header, RTK Query will automatically send a new request to that URL.

However, you can customize this behavior by providing a second argument to `fetchBaseQuery`:

```javascript
const api = createApi({
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({ baseUrl: '/api' }, { redirect: 'manual' }),
  endpoints: (builder) => ({
    getPost: builder.query({
      query: (id) => `post/${id}`,
      providesTags: (result, error, id) => [{ type: 'Post', id }],
    }),
  }),
})
```

In the code above, we're passing an options object with `redirect: 'manual'` to `fetchBaseQuery`. This tells RTK Query not to follow redirects automatically. Instead, it will return the response as is, allowing you to handle the redirection manually in your application.

## Handling 302 Status Errors Manually

If you choose to handle 302 status errors manually, you can do so in the `transformResponse` option of your endpoints. Here's how:

```javascript
const api = createApi({
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({ baseUrl: '/api' }, { redirect: 'manual' }),
  endpoints: (builder) => ({
    getPost: builder.query({
      query: (id) => `post/${id}`,
      providesTags: (result, error, id) => [{ type: 'Post', id }],
      transformResponse: (response) => {
        if (response.status === 302) {
          const newUrl = response.headers.get('Location')
          // Handle the redirection manually...
        }
        return response.json()
      },
    }),
  }),
})
```

In the code above, we're checking if the response status is 302. If it is, we're getting the new URL from the `Location` header and handling the redirection manually.

## Conclusion

Managing 302 status errors can be a challenging task, especially in complex applications. However, with RTK Query, you can easily handle these errors and ensure that your application continues to function smoothly. Whether you choose to let RTK Query handle redirections automatically or handle them manually in your application, understanding how to manage 302 status errors is an essential skill for any developer.

In the world of web development, **302 status errors** are common. They can be frustrating, but with the right knowledge and tools, they can be managed effectively. One such tool is **RTK Query**. This blog post will provide a comprehensive guide on how to manage 302 status errors using RTK Query.

**RTK Query** is a powerful library that provides developers with a set of utilities for managing application state. It's part of the Redux Toolkit, and it simplifies data fetching, caching, synchronization, and updates in your Redux applications.

## Understanding 302 Status Errors

Before we dive into the solution, it's important to understand what a 302 status error is. A **302 status error** is an HTTP response status code that indicates that the requested resource has been temporarily moved to a different URI. Since the location may change in the future, the client should continue to use the original URI.

## Step 1: Setting Up RTK Query

To start, you need to set up RTK Query in your project. If you already have it set up, you can skip this step. To set up RTK Query, you need to install the Redux Toolkit. If you're using npm, you can install it using the following command:

```javascript
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
```

## Step 2: Defining Your API

Once you have RTK Query set up, the next step is to define your API. Here's an example of how you can define your API using RTK Query:

```javascript
import { createApi, fetchBaseQuery } from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react'

export const api = createApi({
  reducerPath: 'api',
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({ baseUrl: '/api' }),
  endpoints: (builder) => ({
    getPosts: builder.query({
      query: () => 'posts',
    }),
  }),
})
```

In this example, we're defining a `getPosts` endpoint that fetches posts from `/api/posts`.

## Step 3: Handling 302 Status Errors

Now, let's talk about how to handle 302 status errors. When you make a request and get a 302 status error, it means that the resource you're trying to access has been temporarily moved. To handle this, you can use the `redirect` option in the `fetchBaseQuery` function.

Here's an example of how you can do this:

```javascript
baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({
  baseUrl: '/api',
  prepareHeaders: (headers, { getState }) => {
    const token = getState().auth.token
    if (token) {
      headers.set('authorization', `Bearer ${token}`)
    }
    return headers
  },
  fetchFn: fetch,
  abortFn: AbortController,
  responseHandler: 'json',
  requestOptions: { redirect: 'follow' }, // This is where you handle the 302 status error
})
```

In this example, we're setting the `redirect` option to `'follow'`. This means that if the server responds with a 302 status error, the fetch API will automatically follow the redirect.

## Step 4: Testing Your Solution

The final step is to test your solution to make sure it works. You can do this by making a request to an endpoint that you know will return a 302 status error and checking to see if the redirect is followed.

Here's an example of how you can do this:

```javascript
import { useGetPostsQuery } from '../api'

function Posts() {
  const { data = [], isFetching } = useGetPostsQuery()

  if (isFetching) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {data.map((post) => (
        <div key={post.id}>{post.title}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

In this example, we're using the `useGetPostsQuery` hook to fetch posts. If the server responds with a 302 status error, the fetch API will follow the redirect and the posts from the new location will be displayed.

## Conclusion

Handling 302 status errors can be tricky, but with RTK Query, it becomes a lot easier. By understanding what a 302 status error is and how to handle it using RTK Query, you can ensure that your application handles redirects seamlessly. Remember, the key to handling 302 status errors is to set the `redirect` option to `'follow'` in the `fetchBaseQuery` function.

I hope this guide has been helpful in your journey to manage 302 status errors using RTK Query. Happy coding!
