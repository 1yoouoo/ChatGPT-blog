## Understanding the Problem

The error message "Spring: Class File has Wrong Version 61.0, Should be 55.0" is a common issue encountered by developers when working with Spring Framework. This error message indicates that the Java compiler's version used to compile the class files is not compatible with the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version that is trying to run the application.

## Common Mistakes Leading to the Error

There are two common mistakes that lead to this error. The first one is **mismatched Java versions**. This occurs when the Java version used to compile the class files is higher than the version of the JRE used to run the application.

The second common mistake is **incorrect configuration of the build tool**. In some cases, the build tool (like Maven or Gradle) might be configured to use a different Java version than the one installed on your system.

## Identifying the Java Versions

Before diving into the solutions, it's essential to identify the Java versions in use. You can check the Java version used by your system by running the following command in your terminal:

```javascript
java -version
```

To check the Java version used by your build tool, you can use the following commands:

For Maven:

```javascript
mvn -v
```

For Gradle:

```javascript
gradle -v
```

## The Solution

The solution to this error is to ensure that the Java version used to compile the class files matches the Java version used to run the application. This can be achieved in two ways: either by upgrading the JRE to match the compiler's version or by downgrading the compiler's version to match the JRE.

## Upgrading the JRE

If you decide to upgrade the JRE, you need to download and install the required version from the official Oracle website. Once installed, you need to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the new JRE installation directory.

## Downgrading the Compiler's Version

If you decide to downgrade the compiler's version, you need to change the Java version used by your build tool. 

For Maven, you can specify the Java version in the `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<properties>
    <maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>
    <maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>
</properties>
```

For Gradle, you can specify the Java version in the `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
sourceCompatibility = 1.8
targetCompatibility = 1.8
```

In both examples, replace `1.8` with the desired Java version.

## Verifying the Solution

After making the changes, you should verify if the error is resolved. You can do this by running your application and checking if the error message still appears.

## A Word of Caution

While it might be tempting to always use the latest Java version, it's important to remember that not all libraries and frameworks might be compatible with it. Therefore, it's always a good idea to check the compatibility of your tools and libraries with the Java version before upgrading.

## Final Thoughts

In conclusion, the "Spring: Class File has Wrong Version 61.0, Should be 55.0" error is a common issue that can be resolved by ensuring that the Java version used to compile the class files matches the Java version used to run the application. By understanding the cause of the error and how to resolve it, developers can save valuable time and avoid unnecessary frustration.

When you're developing with **Spring**, you may encounter an error message that reads, "Class File has Wrong Version 61.0, Should be 55.0". This error message is telling you that there's a mismatch between the Java version used to compile your code and the Java version that Spring is expecting.

## Why does this happen?

This error typically occurs when you're using a newer version of Java to compile your code than the version that Spring was designed to work with. In this case, the error message is telling you that your code was compiled with **Java 17** (version 61.0), but Spring is expecting **Java 11** (version 55.0).

## How to resolve this issue

The simplest way to resolve this issue is to ensure that you're using the correct version of Java to compile your code. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this.

### Step 1: Check your Java version

Firstly, you need to check which version of Java you're currently using. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```javascript
java -version
```

This will display the version of Java that's currently active on your system.

### Step 2: Install the correct Java version

If you find that you're using a version of Java that's newer than Java 11, you'll need to install Java 11 on your system. You can download it from the official Oracle website.

### Step 3: Switch to the correct Java version

Once you've installed Java 11, you'll need to switch to using it. The process for doing this will depend on your operating system. On MacOS and Linux, you can use the `export JAVA_HOME` command to switch Java versions. On Windows, you'll need to update your `PATH` environment variable.

```typescript
export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 11`
```

This command tells your system to use Java 11 as the default version.

### Step 4: Recompile your code

After switching to Java 11, you'll need to recompile your code. You can do this by running your build command again. If you're using Maven, for example, you would run:

```javascript
mvn clean install
```

### Step 5: Verify the solution

Finally, you should verify that the solution has worked by running your code again. If everything has been done correctly, you should no longer see the "Class File has Wrong Version 61.0, Should be 55.0" error.

## Conclusion

The "Class File has Wrong Version 61.0, Should be 55.0" error is a common issue that developers face when working with Spring and newer versions of Java. However, it's relatively straightforward to resolve by ensuring that you're using the correct version of Java to compile your code.

Remember, when working with Spring, it's important to keep in mind the version of Java that it's designed to work with. Using a different version can lead to unexpected errors and issues.
