When incorporating third-party login kits into your web applications, it's not uncommon to encounter errors that can seem daunting at first. One such error is the Redirect URI Error (Code 10006) in TikTok's Login Kit Web Flow. This error typically arises due to misconfiguration or incorrect use of the Login Kit. 

## **Understanding the Redirect URI Error**

The Redirect URI Error (Code 10006) is usually triggered when there's a mismatch between the Redirect URI set in your TikTok Developer Account and the one used in your web application. This discrepancy can cause the TikTok Login Kit to fail, preventing users from logging in using their TikTok credentials.

## **Common Mistake 1: Incorrect Redirect URI Configuration**

The first common mistake is having an incorrect Redirect URI configuration in your TikTok Developer Account. If your Redirect URI in the TikTok Developer Account doesn't match the one used in your application, the login flow will fail.

## **Common Mistake 2: Inconsistent Use of HTTPS**

The second common mistake is inconsistent use of HTTPS. TikTok's Login Kit requires the use of HTTPS for the Redirect URI. If you're testing your application locally using HTTP, you'll need to ensure your application supports HTTPS locally.

## **Troubleshooting with JavaScript**

Here's a sample JavaScript code snippet that you might use to integrate TikTok Login Kit into your application:

```javascript
TikTok.Auth({
    app_id: 'your-app-id',
    redirect_url: 'https://your-redirect-url',
    state: 'your-state',
    scope: 'user.info.basic'
})
```

In this code snippet, you're initializing the TikTok Auth method with your application's ID, redirect URL, state, and scope. The `redirect_url` should match exactly the Redirect URI you've set in your TikTok Developer Account.

## **Understanding the Code**

The `app_id` is the unique identifier of your application, provided by TikTok when you create an application in your developer account. 

The `redirect_url` is the URL to which TikTok will redirect the user after they've successfully logged in. This should be a URL in your application where you handle the login response from TikTok. 

The `state` parameter is a security measure to prevent CSRF attacks. It should be a unique value for each login session.

Finally, the `scope` parameter defines the level of access your application is requesting from the user. In this case, 'user.info.basic' requests access to the user's basic information.

## **Fixing the Error**

To fix the Redirect URI Error, first, ensure that the `redirect_url` in your code exactly matches the Redirect URI set in your TikTok Developer Account. 

Next, make sure your application supports HTTPS, even for local testing. You can use tools like ngrok to expose your local server over HTTPS.

## **Testing the Fix**

After making these changes, test your application again. You should be able to initiate the TikTok Login flow, and upon successful login, the user should be redirected to the `redirect_url` specified in your code.

If you're still encountering the Redirect URI Error, double-check your TikTok Developer Account settings and your application code. Ensure there are no typos or discrepancies.

## **Further Considerations**

While this article focuses on the Redirect URI Error, it's worth noting that other errors can occur when integrating TikTok's Login Kit. Always refer to the official TikTok Developer documentation and ensure your application adheres to TikTok's guidelines and requirements.

Remember, the key to successful integration is accurate configuration and thorough testing. Happy coding!

If you've been working with the TikTok Login Kit Web Flow, you've probably run into the dreaded **Redirect URI Error (Code 10006)**. This error can be a real headache, but don't worry, we're here to help you troubleshoot and resolve it.

## Understanding the Error

Before we dive into how to solve it, it's important to understand what this error is. **Code 10006** is a specific error code that TikTok uses to indicate that there's a problem with the redirect URI you've provided in your application settings. 

In other words, TikTok is telling you that it doesn't recognize or trust the location you're trying to send users to after they authenticate. This is a security feature to prevent unauthorized redirects.

## The Importance of the Redirect URI

The **Redirect URI** is a crucial part of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which TikTok uses for its Login Kit Web Flow. After a user authorizes your application, TikTok redirects them to this URI along with an authorization code. Your application can then exchange this code for an access token.

If the redirect URI isn't exactly the same (including any trailing slashes) as the one you've registered in your TikTok Developer Portal, you'll encounter the **Code 10006** error.

## Step-by-Step Solution

Now that we understand the problem, let's get to solving it. Here's a step-by-step guide to troubleshoot and resolve the Redirect URI Error.

### Step 1: Check Your Application Settings

First, you'll want to check your application settings in the TikTok Developer Portal. Make sure that the redirect URI you've entered there matches exactly with the one in your code.

```javascript
const tiktok = require('tiktok-login-kit');

tiktok.config({
  client_id: 'your-client-id',
  client_secret: 'your-client-secret',
  redirect_uri: 'http://your-redirect-uri'
});
```
In the above JavaScript code, replace `'http://your-redirect-uri'` with the exact URI you've registered in the TikTok Developer Portal.

### Step 2: Check for Trailing Slashes

A common pitfall is the presence of trailing slashes. The redirect URI in your application settings and your code must match exactly, and this includes any trailing slashes (`/`). 

```javascript
tiktok.config({
  redirect_uri: 'http://your-redirect-uri/'
});
```
In the above code, notice the trailing slash at the end of the redirect URI. If your registered URI in the TikTok Developer Portal doesn't have this slash, it will cause the **Code 10006** error.

### Step 3: Check Your Redirect URI Handling

Next, check how your application handles the redirect URI. After TikTok redirects users to this URI, your application needs to handle this request and exchange the authorization code for an access token.

```javascript
app.get('/your-redirect-uri', (req, res) => {
  const code = req.query.code;

  tiktok.exchangeCodeForAccessToken(code)
    .then((access_token) => {
      // Handle access token
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      // Handle error
    });
});
```
In the above code, replace `'/your-redirect-uri'` with the path of your redirect URI. This code sets up an endpoint in your application that handles the redirect from TikTok, retrieves the authorization code from the query parameters, and attempts to exchange it for an access token.

### Step 4: Check Your Error Handling

It's also important to handle any errors that might occur during the token exchange process. This is where you can catch and log any issues that might be causing the **Code 10006** error.

```javascript
tiktok.exchangeCodeForAccessToken(code)
  .then((access_token) => {
    // Handle access token
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error('Error exchanging code for access token:', err);
  });
```
In the above code, we've added a `catch` block to the token exchange promise. If an error occurs, it will be logged to the console. This can provide valuable information for troubleshooting the **Code 10006** error.

## Conclusion

The **Redirect URI Error (Code 10006)** in TikTok's Login Kit Web Flow can be tricky to troubleshoot, but with careful attention to detail and thorough error handling, it can be resolved. Remember, the key is to ensure that your redirect URI matches exactly in your TikTok Developer Portal and your code, and that your application correctly handles the redirect request and any potential errors. 

By following the steps outlined in this post, you should be well on your way to resolving this error and getting your TikTok integration up and running. Happy coding!
