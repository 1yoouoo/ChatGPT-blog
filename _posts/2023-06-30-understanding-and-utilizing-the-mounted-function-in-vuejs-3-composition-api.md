Vue.js is a popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. The Vue.js Composition API is a new addition in Vue 3 that allows developers to better organize their code, making it more readable and maintainable. One of the most commonly used lifecycle hooks in Vue.js is the `mounted` function, which runs after the instance has been mounted. This blog post will dive deep into how to understand and utilize the `mounted` function in VueJs 3 Composition API.

## The Importance of the Mounted Function

The `mounted` function is a lifecycle hook that is called after the Vue instance has been mounted, where the element, passed to `el` in the options, replaces the element it was mounted to. This is where you would put any code that needs to access or manipulate the DOM directly. 

**Common Mistake 1:** One common mistake developers often make is trying to access or manipulate the DOM before the component has been mounted. This will result in an error because the DOM elements the code is trying to access don't exist yet.

**Common Mistake 2:** Another common mistake is forgetting to call `nextTick` in the `mounted` function when you need to access or manipulate the DOM immediately after the data changes. The `nextTick` function ensures that the DOM updates are completed before the code runs.

## Using the Mounted Function in VueJs 3 Composition API

Let's dive into some code to better understand how to use the `mounted` function in VueJs 3 Composition API.

```javascript
import { onMounted } from 'vue'

export default {
  setup() {
    onMounted(() => {
      console.log('Component is mounted')
    })
  }
}
```

In the code above, we're importing the `onMounted` function from `vue`. In the `setup` function, we're calling `onMounted` and passing in a callback function. This callback function will be called when the component is mounted. In this case, it logs 'Component is mounted' to the console.

## Understanding the Role of NextTick

As mentioned earlier, `nextTick` is a method in Vue that you can use to delay the execution of a piece of code until the next DOM update cycle. Let's see how you can use `nextTick` in the `mounted` function.

```javascript
import { onMounted, nextTick } from 'vue'

export default {
  setup() {
    onMounted(async () => {
      await nextTick()
      console.log('Component is mounted and the DOM is updated')
    })
  }
}
```

In the code above, we're importing the `nextTick` function from `vue` in addition to `onMounted`. Inside the `onMounted` callback, we're calling `nextTick` and waiting for it to complete using the `await` keyword. After `nextTick` completes, it means the DOM has been updated, so we log 'Component is mounted and the DOM is updated' to the console.

## A Deeper Dive into the Mounted Function

The `mounted` function is also a great place to add event listeners or fetch data from an API. Here's an example where we fetch data from an API when the component is mounted.

```javascript
import { onMounted, ref } from 'vue'
import axios from 'axios'

export default {
  setup() {
    const data = ref(null)

    onMounted(async () => {
      const response = await axios.get('https://api.example.com/data')
      data.value = response.data
    })

    return { data }
  }
}
```

In the code above, we're importing `ref` from `vue` to create a reactive reference to hold our data. Inside the `onMounted` callback, we're using `axios` to fetch data from an API and storing the result in `data.value`. The `data` is then returned from the `setup` function so it can be used in the template. 

## Dealing with Errors in the Mounted Function

When working with asynchronous operations like fetching data from an API, errors can occur. It's important to handle these errors properly to provide a good user experience. Here's how you can handle errors in the `mounted` function.

```javascript
import { onMounted, ref } from 'vue'
import axios from 'axios'

export default {
  setup() {
    const data = ref(null)
    const error = ref(null)

    onMounted(async () => {
      try {
        const response = await axios.get('https://api.example.com/data')
        data.value = response.data
      } catch (err) {
        error.value = err.message
      }
    })

    return { data, error }
  }
}
```

In the code above, we added a `try/catch` block around the `axios.get` call. If an error occurs when fetching the data, the error message is stored in `error.value`. The `error` is then returned from the `setup` function so it can be displayed in the template.

## The Role of the Unmounted Function

Just as it's important to set up event listeners and fetch data in the `mounted` function, it's equally important to clean up these resources in the `unmounted` function. This function is called when the component is about to be destroyed. Here's how you can use the `unmounted` function in VueJs 3 Composition API.

```javascript
import { onMounted, onUnmounted, ref } from 'vue'

export default {
  setup() {
    const eventHandler = ref(null)

    onMounted(() => {
      eventHandler.value = () => console.log('An event occurred')
      window.addEventListener('event', eventHandler.value)
    })

    onUnmounted(() => {
      window.removeEventListener('event', eventHandler.value)
    })

    return { eventHandler }
  }
}
```

In the code above, we're creating an event handler and adding it as a listener to a global event in the `onMounted` function. In the `onUnmounted` function, we're removing the event listener. This prevents memory leaks and other issues that can occur when event listeners are not properly cleaned up.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we've covered the importance of the `mounted` function in VueJs 3 Composition API, common mistakes when using it, and how to properly use it in your Vue.js applications. We've also looked at how to handle errors and clean up resources in the `unmounted` function. With this knowledge, you'll be able to write more robust and maintainable Vue.js applications.

The `mounted` function is a lifecycle hook in VueJs. It runs after the instance has been mounted, where the `el` is replaced by the newly created `vm.$el`. If you are not familiar with lifecycle hooks, they are a window into how the library you're using works behind-the-scenes, and allow you to manipulate your UI at the right time.

Firstly, let's understand the error. The error usually occurs when the `mounted` function is not properly defined or utilized within the `setup` function in the VueJs 3 Composition API. This error can cause the VueJs application to not render properly or behave unexpectedly.

```javascript
import { onMounted } from 'vue'

export default {
  setup() {
    onMounted(() => {
      console.log('Component is mounted')
    })
  }
}
```

In the above code snippet, the `onMounted` function is imported from 'vue' and used within the `setup` function. This function will run after the component is mounted, and in this case, it will log 'Component is mounted' to the console. If this function is not utilized correctly, it can lead to errors.

The first step in handling this error is to ensure that the `onMounted` function is being imported correctly. If the function is not imported, or if it is misspelled, it can lead to errors. So, double-check the import statement and the spelling of the function.

```javascript
// Correct import
import { onMounted } from 'vue'

// Incorrect import
import { onmountd } from 'vue'
```

In the second code snippet, `onMounted` is misspelled as `onmountd`, which will lead to an error as the function `onmountd` does not exist in 'vue'.

The second step is to ensure that the `onMounted` function is used within the `setup` function. The `setup` function is a new addition in Vue 3, and it is where all the Composition API functions need to be used.

```javascript
// Correct usage
export default {
  setup() {
    onMounted(() => {
      console.log('Component is mounted')
    })
  }
}

// Incorrect usage
export default {
  onMounted(() => {
    console.log('Component is mounted')
  })
}
```

In the second code snippet, `onMounted` is used outside the `setup` function, which is incorrect and will lead to an error.

The third step is to ensure that the `onMounted` function is called with a function as its argument. This function will be executed when the component is mounted.

```javascript
// Correct usage
onMounted(() => {
  console.log('Component is mounted')
})

// Incorrect usage
onMounted('Component is mounted')
```

In the second code snippet, `onMounted` is called with a string as its argument, which is incorrect and will lead to an error.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve any errors related to the `mounted` function in VueJs 3 Composition API. Remember to import the function correctly, use it within the `setup` function, and call it with a function as its argument.

In conclusion, understanding and utilizing the `mounted` function in VueJs 3 Composition API is crucial for developing VueJs applications. This function allows you to execute code after your component is mounted, which can be useful for various tasks such as fetching data or manipulating the DOM. However, it is important to use this function correctly to avoid errors and ensure that your application works as expected.
