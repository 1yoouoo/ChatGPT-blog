If you're a developer working with **NestJs**, you might have encountered the Eslint error `is defined but never used` while using decorators. This error can be quite frustrating, especially if you're new to the framework. However, don't worry. This post will guide you through the process of resolving this error.

## Understanding the Eslint Error `is defined but never used`

Before we delve into the solutions, it's important to understand what this error means. Basically, **Eslint** is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. The error `is defined but never used` pops up when you've defined a variable, function, or import that you're not using anywhere in your code.

This error is common and can occur due to a variety of reasons. One of the most common mistakes is that you might have imported a module or defined a variable with the intention of using it later, but then forgotten about it. Alternatively, you might have refactored your code and removed the usage of an import or variable, but forgotten to remove the definition itself.

## How Decorators Work in NestJs

In **NestJs**, decorators are a special kind of declaration that can be attached to a class declaration, method, accessor, property, or parameter. Decorators use the form `@expression`, where expression must evaluate to a function that will be called at runtime with information about the decorated declaration.

Here's an example of a decorator in **NestJs**:

```typescript
import { Controller, Get } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {
  @Get()
  findAll() {
    return 'This action returns all cats';
  }
}
```

In this code, `@Controller('cats')` is a class decorator and `@Get()` is a method decorator. These decorators are part of the **NestJs** framework and they are used to provide metadata about the class or method they are attached to. However, if you're not using these decorators anywhere else in your code, **Eslint** will throw the error `is defined but never used`.

## Resolving the Error

To resolve this error, you have two options. The first is to simply use the import or variable that's causing the error. This might mean writing new code or modifying existing code to incorporate the unused import or variable.

The second option is to remove the unused import or variable. This is often the best solution if you've refactored your code and no longer need the import or variable. However, you should be careful when removing imports or variables, as this could potentially break your code if you're not careful.

Here's how you can remove the unused decorator from the previous example:

```typescript
import { Controller } from '@nestjs/common';

@Controller('cats')
export class CatsController {
  findAll() {
    return 'This action returns all cats';
  }
}
```

In this code, I've removed the `@Get()` decorator and the corresponding import since they're not being used. Now, **Eslint** will no longer throw the error `is defined but never used`.

## Eslint Configuration

Another way to resolve this error is by configuring **Eslint** to ignore certain patterns. This can be useful if you're using a library or framework like **NestJs** that relies heavily on decorators, and you want to avoid getting the `is defined but never used` error for every decorator you use.

To configure **Eslint** to ignore decorators, you can add the following rule to your `.eslintrc` file:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "no-unused-vars": ["error", { "varsIgnorePattern": "[iI]gnored" }]
  }
}
```

In this configuration, **Eslint** will ignore any variable that matches the regular expression `[iI]gnored`. You can replace this with any pattern that matches the names of your decorators.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the Eslint error `is defined but never used` can be quite frustrating when working with decorators in **NestJs**. However, by understanding what this error means and how decorators work, you can easily resolve it. Whether you choose to use the unused import or variable, remove it, or configure **Eslint** to ignore certain patterns, the solution ultimately depends on your specific use case and coding style.

If you are a developer, you've probably encountered the **Eslint Error `is defined but never used`**. This error is common when working with **Decorators** in **NestJs**. It can be frustrating and time-consuming to resolve, especially when you're in the middle of coding. But don't worry, in this blog post, we will take a deep dive into this error, and provide a detailed, step-by-step solution to help you resolve it.

**Eslint** is a static code analysis tool that is used to identify problematic patterns found in JavaScript code. It flags the code when it finds an issue, one such issue being the `is defined but never used` error. This error occurs when a variable, function, or import is declared but not used anywhere in the code. 

---

In **NestJs**, which is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications, we often use **Decorators**. Decorators are a special kind of declaration that can be attached to a class declaration, method, accessor, property, or parameter. In some cases, we define a decorator but don't use it, leading to the Eslint error `is defined but never used`.

---

Let's take a look at an example. Consider the following TypeScript code:

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class AppService {
  getHello(): string {
    return 'Hello World!';
  }
}
```

---

In this code, we have imported the `Injectable` decorator from `@nestjs/common`. However, if we don't use this decorator anywhere in our code, Eslint will throw the error `Injectable is defined but never used`.

---

To resolve this error, we need to ensure that every imported module, function, or variable is used in our code. In our case, we need to use the `Injectable` decorator. The `Injectable` decorator is a class decorator that allows you to mark a class as available to be provided and injected as a dependency.

---

So, how do we use the `Injectable` decorator? We simply prefix our class declaration with `@Injectable()`. Let's modify our previous code:

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class AppService {
  getHello(): string {
    return 'Hello World!';
  }
}
```

---

Now, the `Injectable` decorator is used to decorate the `AppService` class. This tells NestJs to treat `AppService` as a provider, meaning it can be injected into other classes. As a result, the Eslint error `is defined but never used` is resolved.

---

But what if we have a scenario where we have to import a decorator but don't want to use it immediately? In such a case, we can use Eslint's `/* eslint-disable */` comment to temporarily disable Eslint for a specific line or block of code.

---

Consider the following example:

```typescript
/* eslint-disable */
import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';
/* eslint-enable */

@Injectable()
export class AppService {
  getHello(): string {
    return 'Hello World!';
  }
}
```

---

In this code, we have disabled Eslint for the line where we import the `Injectable` decorator. This way, Eslint won't throw an error even though `Injectable` is not used immediately after being imported. However, remember to enable Eslint again after the line or block of code where it's not needed, as we have done with `/* eslint-enable */`.

---

In conclusion, the Eslint error `is defined but never used` is a common issue when working with Decorators in NestJs. This error occurs when we define something but don't use it in our code. To resolve this error, we need to ensure that we use everything that we define. If we need to define something but don't want to use it immediately, we can temporarily disable Eslint for that specific line or block of code.

---

Understanding and resolving this error not only helps in writing clean and efficient code, but also in understanding the core concepts of NestJs and decorators. We hope this guide has been helpful in understanding and resolving the Eslint error `is defined but never used` for Decorators in NestJs. Happy coding!
