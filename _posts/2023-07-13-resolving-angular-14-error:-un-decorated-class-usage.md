Angular, a widely-used JavaScript framework, is known for its versatility and robustness. However, like any other framework, it's not immune to errors. One such issue that developers often grapple with is the "Un-decorated Class Usage" error. In this article, we will delve deep into the root cause of this error and provide a comprehensive guide on how to resolve it.

## Understanding the Un-decorated Class Usage Error

**The Un-decorated Class Usage error** typically pops up when you're trying to use a class that hasn't been decorated with an Angular decorator, such as `@Component`, `@Directive`, `@NgModule`, `@Pipe`, or `@Injectable`. These decorators are crucial because they provide metadata that tells Angular how to process a class.

So, the first common mistake that leads to this error is *not using a decorator where it's required*. 

```javascript
export class MyComponent {
  // code...
}
```
In the example above, `MyComponent` is an un-decorated class. To fix the error, you need to add a decorator to it. 

```javascript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'my-component',
  templateUrl: './my-component.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./my-component.component.css']
})
export class MyComponent {
  // code...
}
```
Now, `MyComponent` is decorated with `@Component`, and the error should be resolved.

The second common mistake is *using a decorator incorrectly or inappropriately*. This typically happens when developers are not familiar with Angular's decorators and how they should be used. 

```javascript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component()  // <- Error: Missing metadata
export class MyComponent {
  // code...
}
```
In the example above, the `@Component` decorator is used without any metadata. This is incorrect because Angular needs this metadata to understand how to process the class. To fix the error, you need to provide the required metadata.

```javascript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'my-component',
  templateUrl: './my-component.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./my-component.component.css']
})
export class MyComponent {
  // code...
}
```
With the correct metadata, Angular can now process `MyComponent` without any issues.

## Debugging the Un-decorated Class Usage Error

Debugging this error involves identifying the un-decorated class and adding the appropriate decorator with the correct metadata. This can be tricky, especially in large applications with many components, modules, and services. However, Angular provides error messages that can guide you to the problematic class. 

For instance, if you see an error message like this:

```javascript
Error: Un-decorated class usage detected
       in /path/to/your/file.ts
```
This tells you that the un-decorated class is in `file.ts`. You can then open this file and inspect the classes to identify which one is un-decorated.

## Resolving the Un-decorated Class Usage Error

Once you've identified the un-decorated class, the next step is to resolve the error. This involves adding the appropriate decorator and providing the correct metadata. 

For example, if you have a service class that is un-decorated:

```javascript
export class MyService {
  // code...
}
```
You can resolve the error by adding the `@Injectable` decorator:

```javascript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class MyService {
  // code...
}
```
Now, `MyService` is decorated with `@Injectable`, and Angular can process it without any issues.

## Final Words

Understanding and resolving the Un-decorated Class Usage error in Angular is crucial for building robust applications. By identifying the un-decorated class and adding the appropriate decorator with the correct metadata, you can resolve this error and ensure that your application runs smoothly. As always, remember to test your application thoroughly after making any changes to ensure that everything works as expected.

If you're working with Angular 14, you may have encountered the error message `Error: Un-decorated class usage`. This error can be a bit perplexing, especially if you're not familiar with Angular decorators. But fear not, in this blog post, we'll delve into what this error means and provide a step-by-step guide on how to fix it.

## Understanding the Error

Before we jump into the solution, it's crucial to understand what the error is trying to communicate. The `Error: Un-decorated class usage` typically arises when we try to use a class that doesn't have a decorator in Angular. 

In Angular, decorators are special kinds of declarations that can be attached to classes, methods, and properties. They're used to modify or augment the behavior of the classes, methods, or properties they're attached to. When Angular encounters a class without a decorator in a context where one is expected, it throws the `Un-decorated class usage` error.

## Step-by-Step Solution

Now that we understand the error, let's get into how to resolve it. We'll break it down into simple, manageable steps.

### Step 1: Identify the Class

The first step is to identify the class that's causing the error. The error message should provide the name of the class. For example, if the error message is `Error: Un-decorated class usage in 'MyClass'`, then `MyClass` is the class causing the error.

### Step 2: Check the Class Usage

Next, check how the class is being used. Is it being used as a component, a service, or a module? This will determine what kind of decorator you should use.

### Step 3: Add the Appropriate Decorator

Once you've determined how the class is being used, you need to add the appropriate decorator. Here are some examples:

```typescript
// If MyClass is a component
@Component({
  selector: 'my-component',
  templateUrl: './my.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./my.component.css']
})
export class MyClass { }

// If MyClass is a service
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class MyClass { }

// If MyClass is a module
@NgModule({
  declarations: [],
  imports: [],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: []
})
export class MyClass { }
```

### Step 4: Verify the Solution

After adding the decorator, try running your Angular application again. If you've correctly identified the problem and added the right decorator, the `Un-decorated class usage` error should no longer appear.

## Deep Dive into Decorators

Now that we've resolved the error, let's take a deeper look into decorators and why they're so important in Angular.

Decorators are a feature of TypeScript, the language that Angular is built with. They provide a way to add annotations and a meta-programming syntax for class declarations and members. Angular has its own set of decorators that it uses to understand the parts of your application and how they work together.

Here's a brief overview of some of the most commonly used Angular decorators:

- `@Component`: This decorator indicates that the class is a component. It provides metadata about the component, such as its selector (the custom HTML tag that Angular will recognize and render the component as), its template (the HTML that the component will render), and its styles.

- `@Injectable`: This decorator marks a class as available to be provided and injected as a dependency. It's typically used with services, which are classes that encapsulate specific functionality or data and can be shared across components.

- `@NgModule`: This decorator marks a class as an Angular module. An Angular module is a way to group related components, directives, pipes, and services together. The `@NgModule` decorator provides metadata about the module, such as what components it declares, what other modules it imports, and what services it provides.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the `Error: Un-decorated class usage` in Angular is typically caused by trying to use a class without a decorator in a context where one is expected. The solution is to add the appropriate decorator to the class, depending on how the class is being used.

Remember, decorators are a crucial part of Angular. They provide a way to tell Angular how to treat different parts of your application. Understanding them can help you not only resolve errors like this one, but also write more effective and efficient Angular code.

So next time you encounter the `Un-decorated class usage` error, don't panic. Just follow the steps outlined in this blog post, and you'll have it resolved in no time. Happy coding!
