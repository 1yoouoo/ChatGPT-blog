## **Understanding the Error**

The "This Method Should Only Be Accessed from Tests or Within Private Scope" error in AdRequest is a common stumbling block for many developers. This error typically occurs when you're trying to access a method that's been designated as private or is intended solely for testing purposes. 

## **Why This Error Occurs**

There are two primary reasons why you might encounter this error:

1. **Accessing a Private Method:** If you're trying to access a method that's been marked as private, you'll encounter this error. In JavaScript and TypeScript, private methods are intended to be used only within the class or object where they're defined.

2. **Accessing a Test-Only Method:** Some methods are designed to be used only for testing. If you're trying to access one of these methods outside of a test environment, you'll run into this error.

## **Example of the Error**

Let's take a look at an example of this error. Suppose we have a class `AdRequest` with a private method `getAdData()`. 

```javascript
class AdRequest {
  #getAdData() {
    // some code here
  }
}
```

If you try to access `getAdData()` outside of the `AdRequest` class, you'll encounter the error.

```javascript
const adRequest = new AdRequest();
adRequest.getAdData(); // Error: This Method Should Only Be Accessed from Tests or Within Private Scope
```

## **Resolving the Error**

To resolve this error, you need to ensure that you're only accessing private or test-only methods within the appropriate scope. 

For private methods, this means accessing them only within the class or object where they're defined. For test-only methods, this means accessing them only within a test environment.

## **Example of Resolving the Error**

Let's modify our previous example to resolve the error. Instead of trying to access `getAdData()` directly, we'll create a public method within the `AdRequest` class that can access it.

```javascript
class AdRequest {
  #getAdData() {
    // some code here
  }

  public fetchAd() {
    return this.#getAdData();
  }
}
```

Now, you can use the `fetchAd()` method to indirectly access `getAdData()` without encountering the error.

```javascript
const adRequest = new AdRequest();
adRequest.fetchAd(); // No error
```

## **Additional Tips**

Remember, private and test-only methods are designated as such for a reason. They're not intended to be accessed directly, but rather to support other, public methods. 

Always respect the intended scope of methods. If you find yourself frequently needing to access a private or test-only method, it might be a sign that your code needs refactoring.

If you're a developer, you've likely encountered the **'This Method Should Only Be Accessed from Tests or Within Private Scope'** error in AdRequest. This error can be perplexing, especially if you're not sure where it's coming from or how to fix it. But don't worry, in this blog post, we'll delve into the details of this error and provide a comprehensive, step-by-step solution to resolve it.

In the world of programming, errors are inevitable. They are part and parcel of the development process. However, understanding the root cause of an error and knowing how to fix it is crucial. This particular error usually pops up when you're trying to access a method that should only be accessed from tests or within a private scope.

## Step 1: Understanding the Error

The first step in resolving any error is understanding what it means. In JavaScript or TypeScript, methods can be declared as private, meaning they can only be accessed within the class they are declared in. If you try to access these methods outside the class or from a test, you'll encounter the **'This Method Should Only Be Accessed from Tests or Within Private Scope'** error.

```javascript
class MyClass {
  private myMethod() {
    // some code here
  }
}

const myClass = new MyClass();
myClass.myMethod(); // This will throw an error
```

In the code snippet above, `myMethod` is a private method in the `MyClass` class. Trying to call `myMethod` from an instance of `MyClass` will result in the aforementioned error.

## Step 2: Identifying the Culprit

Identify the method that is causing the error. This may seem obvious, but it's an essential step. The error message will usually point you to the method in question. In our case, it's `myMethod` in the `MyClass` class.

## Step 3: Checking the Access Modifiers

Check the access modifiers of the method. In JavaScript or TypeScript, these are `public`, `private`, and `protected`. If the method is marked as `private`, it means it can only be accessed within the class it is defined. If it is marked as `protected`, it can be accessed within the class and its subclasses.

```typescript
class MyClass {
  private myMethod() {
    // some code here
  }
}

class MySubClass extends MyClass {
  anotherMethod() {
    this.myMethod(); // This will throw an error
  }
}
```

In the TypeScript code above, `myMethod` is a private method in the `MyClass` class. Trying to call `myMethod` from a subclass of `MyClass` (`MySubClass`) will result in an error.

## Step 4: Changing the Access Modifiers

If you need to access the method from outside the class or from a subclass, consider changing the access modifier to `public`. However, do this only if it's absolutely necessary and won't violate the principles of encapsulation.

```typescript
class MyClass {
  public myMethod() {
    // some code here
  }
}

const myClass = new MyClass();
myClass.myMethod(); // This will not throw an error
```

In the code snippet above, changing the access modifier of `myMethod` to `public` allows it to be called from an instance of `MyClass` without throwing an error.

## Step 5: Testing Your Solution

The final step is to test your solution. Make sure that changing the access modifier doesn't introduce any new errors or bugs into your code. Run your tests to ensure everything works as expected.

In conclusion, the **'This Method Should Only Be Accessed from Tests or Within Private Scope'** error in AdRequest is caused by attempting to access a method marked as `private` or `protected` from outside its class or from a test. The solution is to identify the method causing the error, check its access modifiers, and if necessary, change the access modifier to `public`. However, remember to always adhere to the principles of encapsulation and only change access modifiers when it's absolutely necessary.
