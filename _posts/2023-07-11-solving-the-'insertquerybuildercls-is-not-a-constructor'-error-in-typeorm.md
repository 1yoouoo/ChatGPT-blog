## **Understanding the 'InsertQueryBuilderCls is not a constructor' Error**

The `'InsertQueryBuilderCls is not a constructor'` error is a common issue faced by developers using TypeORM, a versatile Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for TypeScript and JavaScript. This error typically arises when attempting to perform an insert operation using the `InsertQueryBuilderCls` class, which is not recognized as a constructor.

## **Common Mistakes Leading to the Error**

The occurrence of this error can be attributed to two common mistakes. 

* The first common mistake is **not correctly importing the `InsertQueryBuilderCls` class**. It's essential to import the class correctly from the TypeORM package to use it as a constructor.

* The second mistake is **using the `InsertQueryBuilderCls` class when it's not supported or not available**. This error can occur if the version of TypeORM you're using doesn't support this class, or if it's not available in the current context.

## **Importing the `InsertQueryBuilderCls` Class Correctly**

To avoid the first mistake, ensure that you're importing the `InsertQueryBuilderCls` class correctly. The import statement should look like this in TypeScript:

```typescript
import {InsertQueryBuilderCls} from "typeorm";
```

In this example, the `InsertQueryBuilderCls` class is imported from the `typeorm` package. If the class is not recognized as a constructor, it could be because it's not imported correctly.

## **Checking the Availability of the `InsertQueryBuilderCls` Class**

To avoid the second mistake, check if the `InsertQueryBuilderCls` class is available and supported in your version of TypeORM. You can do this by checking the TypeORM documentation or the source code. If the class is not available, you might need to use a different method for performing the insert operation.

## **Alternative Methods for Insert Operations**

If the `InsertQueryBuilderCls` class is not available or not supported, you can use other methods provided by TypeORM for insert operations. For instance, you can use the `Repository.save` method, which can handle both insert and update operations. Here's an example:

```javascript
import {EntityRepository, Repository} from "typeorm";
import {User} from "./User";

@EntityRepository(User)
export class UserRepository extends Repository<User> {
    async saveUser(user: User) {
        return await this.save(user);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `saveUser` method uses the `Repository.save` method to save a `User` entity. If the `User` entity does not exist in the database, it will be inserted. If it already exists, it will be updated.

## **Using the QueryBuilder for Insert Operations**

Another alternative is to use the `QueryBuilder` for insert operations. The `QueryBuilder` provides a flexible way to construct SQL queries. Here's an example:

```javascript
import {getConnection} from "typeorm";

async function insertUser(user: User) {
    return await getConnection()
        .createQueryBuilder()
        .insert()
        .into(User)
        .values(user)
        .execute();
}
```

In this example, the `insertUser` function uses the `QueryBuilder` to construct an insert query for the `User` entity.

## **Resolving the Error**

To resolve the `'InsertQueryBuilderCls is not a constructor'` error, you should first verify that you're importing the `InsertQueryBuilderCls` class correctly. If the import is correct, check if the class is available and supported in your version of TypeORM.

If the `InsertQueryBuilderCls` class is not available or not supported, consider using alternative methods for insert operations, such as the `Repository.save` method or the `QueryBuilder`.

Remember that understanding the cause of the error is the first step to resolving it. By being aware of common mistakes and knowing how to avoid them, you can prevent this error from occurring in your TypeORM projects.

If you've been working with TypeORM and have come across the `InsertQueryBuilderCls is not a constructor` error, you're not alone. This error can be quite frustrating, but don't worry, we're here to help you solve this issue. 

**TypeORM** is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for TypeScript and JavaScript that aims to simplify the process of working with databases. However, like any other library, it can sometimes throw errors that can be hard to decipher. 

In this blog post, we'll be taking a deep dive into the `InsertQueryBuilderCls is not a constructor` error, exploring what causes it and how to fix it. 

## Understanding the Error

Before we can solve the error, it's important to understand what it means. The `InsertQueryBuilderCls is not a constructor` error occurs when you try to instantiate a class that doesn't have a constructor defined. 

In JavaScript and TypeScript, a `constructor` is a special method of a class for creating and initializing an object of that class. If you try to call a class as a function without using the `new` keyword, you'll get this error. 

Here's an example of what could cause this error:

```javascript
class MyClass {}

const instance = MyClass(); // This will throw an error
```

In the above example, we're trying to call `MyClass` as a function, but it's a class and needs to be instantiated with the `new` keyword:

```javascript
class MyClass {}

const instance = new MyClass(); // This is correct
```

## The Root Cause

In the context of TypeORM, the `InsertQueryBuilderCls is not a constructor` error typically occurs when you're trying to use the `createQueryBuilder` method of a repository to insert data into a database.

Here's an example:

```javascript
const user = await userRepository
  .createQueryBuilder('user')
  .insert()
  .into(User)
  .values({ name: 'John Doe' })
  .execute();
```

In the above example, we're trying to create a new query builder, then use it to insert a new user into the database. However, this will throw the `InsertQueryBuilderCls is not a constructor` error because the `createQueryBuilder` method is not meant to be used for insert operations.

## The Solution

The solution to the `InsertQueryBuilderCls is not a constructor` error is quite simple: you should use the `insert` method of the repository directly, instead of using the `createQueryBuilder` method.

Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
const user = await userRepository
  .insert({ name: 'John Doe' });
```

In the above example, we're directly calling the `insert` method of the repository, which is the correct way to insert data into a database in TypeORM.

## Conclusion

The `InsertQueryBuilderCls is not a constructor` error in TypeORM can be quite confusing, especially if you're new to the library. However, once you understand that you should use the `insert` method of the repository directly for insert operations, instead of the `createQueryBuilder` method, the error becomes quite easy to solve.

Remember, when you're working with TypeORM or any other library, it's important to understand the API and how to use it correctly. When in doubt, always refer to the official documentation or seek help from the community.
