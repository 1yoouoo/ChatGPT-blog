## **Introduction**

In the world of Vue.js development, testing is a critical aspect that ensures the reliability and stability of your application. One of the common tools used for testing Vue.js applications is **Jest**, a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity. However, developers often encounter issues when mounting components with Jest in a Vue.js environment, especially when using the Composition API with TypeScript and Vuetify. This article aims to guide you through resolving these issues using Vue-Test-Utils.

## **Understanding the Problem**

Before diving into the solution, it's important to understand the problem. The two most common mistakes that lead to Jest mounting issues are:

1. **Incorrect setup of Vue-Test-Utils**: Vue-Test-Utils is the official unit testing utility library for Vue.js. It provides methods for testing your Vue components. However, if not set up correctly, it can lead to mounting issues when testing with Jest.

2. **Misconfiguration of Jest with Vue, TypeScript, and Vuetify**: Jest needs to be correctly configured to work with Vue, TypeScript, and Vuetify. Any misconfiguration can lead to issues when mounting components.

## **Incorrect Setup of Vue-Test-Utils**

Let's start with the first issue - incorrect setup of Vue-Test-Utils. Here is an example of a common incorrect setup:

```javascript
import { createLocalVue, mount } from '@vue/test-utils'
import Vuetify from 'vuetify'
import Component from '@/components/Component.vue'

let wrapper

beforeEach(() => {
  const localVue = createLocalVue()
  localVue.use(Vuetify)
  wrapper = mount(Component, { localVue })
})

// Tests here...
```

In this setup, we're creating a local Vue instance and using Vuetify with it. However, this setup doesn't include the necessary configuration for Vuetify, leading to warnings about missing Vuetify components when running your tests.

## **Correct Setup of Vue-Test-Utils**

Here is how you should correctly set up Vue-Test-Utils:

```javascript
import { createLocalVue, mount } from '@vue/test-utils'
import Vuetify from 'vuetify'
import Component from '@/components/Component.vue'

let wrapper

beforeEach(() => {
  const localVue = createLocalVue()
  localVue.use(Vuetify)

  const vuetify = new Vuetify()

  wrapper = mount(Component, {
    localVue,
    vuetify,
  })
})

// Tests here...
```

In this setup, we're creating a new instance of Vuetify and passing it as an option to the mount function. This ensures that Vuetify is correctly set up for your tests.

## **Misconfiguration of Jest with Vue, TypeScript, and Vuetify**

The second common mistake is the misconfiguration of Jest. Here is an example of a common incorrect Jest configuration:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  preset: '@vue/cli-plugin-unit-jest',
}
```

This configuration doesn't include the necessary setup for TypeScript and Vuetify, leading to errors when running your tests.

## **Correct Configuration of Jest with Vue, TypeScript, and Vuetify**

Here is how you should correctly configure Jest:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  preset: '@vue/cli-plugin-unit-jest/presets/typescript-and-babel',
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.vue$': 'vue-jest',
    '.+\\.(css|styl|less|sass|scss|png|jpg|ttf|woff|woff2)$': 'jest-transform-stub',
  },
  transformIgnorePatterns: ['/node_modules/(?!vuetify)'],
}
```

In this configuration, we're using the `typescript-and-babel` preset, which includes the necessary setup for TypeScript. We're also adding transform rules for `.vue` files and static files, and we're telling Jest not to transform the Vuetify module.

## **Putting It All Together**

Now that we've resolved the common issues, let's put it all together. Here is a complete example of a test file:

```javascript
import { createLocalVue, mount } from '@vue/test-utils'
import Vuetify from 'vuetify'
import Component from '@/components/Component.vue'

let wrapper

beforeEach(() => {
  const localVue = createLocalVue()
  localVue.use(Vuetify)

  const vuetify = new Vuetify()

  wrapper = mount(Component, {
    localVue,
    vuetify,
  })
})

describe('Component', () => {
  it('renders a vue instance', () => {
    expect(wrapper.isVueInstance()).toBeTruthy()
  })
})
```

And here is the corresponding Jest configuration:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  preset: '@vue/cli-plugin-unit-jest/presets/typescript-and-babel',
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.vue$': 'vue-jest',
    '.+\\.(css|styl|less|sass|scss|png|jpg|ttf|woff|woff2)$': 'jest-transform-stub',
  },
  transformIgnorePatterns: ['/node_modules/(?!vuetify)'],
}
```

With these setups, your Jest mounting issues with Vue, TypeScript, and Vuetify should be resolved. Happy testing!

In this blog post, we'll be discussing one of the common issues that developers face when working with `Vue 2.7`, `TypeScript (TS)`, `Vuetify` and `Jest` - mounting issues with `Composition-API` components using `Vue-Test-Utils`. 

## Understanding the Issue

Before we delve into the solution, let's first understand the problem. While using `Vue-Test-Utils` to mount a `Composition-API` component, you might encounter a mounting issue. This can occur due to a plethora of reasons, but the most common one is the incompatibility between `Vue 2.7` and the `Composition-API`. 

## Step-by-Step Solution

Now that we've understood the problem, let's move on to the solution. Here, we'll break down the solution into simple, easy-to-follow steps.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Firstly, ensure that all the necessary dependencies are installed. You will need `Vue 2.7`, `TypeScript`, `Vuetify`, `Jest`, and `Vue-Test-Utils`. Use the following commands to install these dependencies:

```javascript
npm install vue@2.7
npm install typescript
npm install vuetify
npm install jest
npm install @vue/test-utils
```

### Step 2: Update Vue Configuration

Next, update your `vue.config.js` to include `transpileDependencies`. This ensures that Babel transpiles Vuetify components.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  transpileDependencies: ["vuetify"]
};
```

### Step 3: Setup Jest Configuration

In your Jest configuration file, you'll need to specify a `transform` property to tell Jest how to handle `*.vue` files.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  //...
  transform: {
    // process `*.vue` files with `vue-jest`
    ".*\\.(vue)$": "vue-jest",
    // process js with `babel-jest`
    "^.+\\.js$": "babel-jest"
  },
  //...
};
```

### Step 4: Update Babel Configuration

Update your `babel.config.js` to use the `@babel/preset-env` preset. This allows you to use the latest JavaScript features.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  presets: ["@babel/preset-env"]
};
```

### Step 5: Mount the Component

Now, you're ready to mount your component. Use `mount` from `@vue/test-utils` to do this.

```javascript
import { mount } from "@vue/test-utils";
import YourComponent from "@/components/YourComponent.vue";

describe("YourComponent.vue", () => {
  it("renders properly", () => {
    const wrapper = mount(YourComponent);
    expect(wrapper.html()).toMatchSnapshot();
  });
});
```

### Step 6: Run Jest

Finally, run Jest to see if the issue has been resolved.

```javascript
npm run test
```

## Conclusion

By following the above steps, you should be able to resolve the Jest mounting issues with `Composition-API` component on `Vue 2.7` + `TS` + `Vuetify` using `Vue-Test-Utils`. Remember, the key is to ensure that all your dependencies are correctly installed and configured. Happy coding!
