## Understanding the Issue

When working with **NestJs Cache-Manager**, you might encounter an error message that reads `'TypeError: store.get is not a function'`. This error is common and can be quite frustrating, especially if you're not sure why it's happening. In this post, we will delve into the causes of this error and provide solutions to help you resolve it.

## Common Causes of the Error

There are a few reasons why you might be seeing this error in your NestJs application. Here are the two most common causes:

1. **Incorrect Store Configuration**: This error is often caused by an incorrect store configuration. If the store is not properly set up, the `get` function may not be available as expected, leading to the error.

2. **Incompatible Cache-Manager Version**: If you're using a version of cache-manager that isn't compatible with your version of NestJs, this could also trigger the error. NestJs might be trying to call a function that doesn't exist in the version of cache-manager you're using.

## Understanding the Store Configuration

In NestJs, the store is an object that holds the state of your application. It's where you keep data that you want to access across different parts of your application. 

Here's an example of what a basic store configuration might look like:

```typescript
import { CacheModule } from '@nestjs/common';
import * as store from 'cache-manager';

CacheModule.register({
  store: store,
  ttl: 600,
});
```
In this example, we're importing the `CacheModule` from `@nestjs/common` and `store` from `cache-manager`. We then register our store with a `ttl` (time to live) of 600 seconds. 

## The Role of the Get Function

The `get` function is a method provided by cache-manager to retrieve data from the store. When you call `store.get('key')`, cache-manager will attempt to retrieve the data associated with the given key from the store. If the `get` function is not available, it means that there is something wrong with the store configuration or the cache-manager version.

## How to Correct the Store Configuration

To solve the `'TypeError: store.get is not a function'` error, you'll need to check your store configuration. Make sure that you're importing the correct store from cache-manager and that you're registering it correctly in the `CacheModule`.

```typescript
import { CacheModule } from '@nestjs/common';
import * as cacheManager from 'cache-manager';

CacheModule.register({
  store: cacheManager.caching({store: 'memory', max: 100, ttl: 600}),
});
```

In this corrected example, we're importing `cacheManager` instead of `store` from `cache-manager`. We're also using the `caching` method provided by cache-manager to initialize our store.

## Checking the Cache-Manager Version

If correcting the store configuration doesn't solve the error, you might be using an incompatible version of cache-manager. Check the version of cache-manager you're using by running `npm list cache-manager` in your console. 

If you're using a version that isn't compatible with your version of NestJs, you'll need to upgrade or downgrade cache-manager. You can do this by running `npm install cache-manager@version`, replacing `version` with the version number that is compatible with your NestJs version.

## In Conclusion

By understanding the causes of the `'TypeError: store.get is not a function'` error and how to fix them, you can avoid this common pitfall in NestJs development. Always remember to check your store configuration and the compatibility of your cache-manager version when you encounter this error. Happy coding!

If you're a developer working with **NestJs**, you might have encountered the `TypeError: store.get is not a function` error when using the Cache-Manager. This error can be quite perplexing, especially if you're new to the framework. But don't worry, I've got you covered. In this post, we'll go through the problem in detail and provide a step-by-step solution.

## Understanding the Error

Before we dive into the solution, let's understand what this error means. The `TypeError: store.get is not a function` error is thrown when the Cache-Manager tries to call the `get` method on the `store` object, but it can't find this method. This usually happens when the `store` object is not properly initialized or the wrong type of `store` is being used.

```typescript
const cacheManager = require('cache-manager');
const store = {}; // This should be an instance of a valid store
const cache = cacheManager.caching({store});
cache.get('key', function(err, result) {
    console.log(result);
});
```

In the above code snippet, we're trying to use an empty object `{}` as a store, which will result in a `TypeError: store.get is not a function` error because an empty object does not have a `get` method.

## Identifying the Issue

The first step in solving this error is identifying where the issue is coming from. The error message gives us a clue - `store.get is not a function`. This tells us that the problem is with the `store` object. 

```typescript
const cacheManager = require('cache-manager');
const store = 'memory'; // This is the correct type of store
const cache = cacheManager.caching({store});
cache.get('key', function(err, result) {
    console.log(result);
});
```

In the above code, we have used `memory` as the store, which is a valid store type for cache-manager, and this code will not result in an error.

## Choosing the Right Store

The `store` object is responsible for managing how your cache data is stored and retrieved. Cache-Manager supports various types of stores like `memory`, `redis`, etc. It's important to choose the right type of store based on your application's needs.

```typescript
const cacheManager = require('cache-manager');
const redisStore = require('cache-manager-redis-store');
const store = redisStore; // Using Redis as the store
const cache = cacheManager.caching({store});
cache.get('key', function(err, result) {
    console.log(result);
});
```

In this code snippet, we're using `Redis` as the store. This is a good choice if you need a distributed cache that can be shared across multiple instances of your application.

## Initializing the Store Correctly

Once you've chosen the right type of store, it's important to initialize it correctly. This usually involves passing the correct configuration options to the `caching` function.

```typescript
const cacheManager = require('cache-manager');
const redisStore = require('cache-manager-redis-store');
const store = redisStore;
const cache = cacheManager.caching({store, host: 'localhost', port: 6379});
cache.get('key', function(err, result) {
    console.log(result);
});
```

In this example, we're initializing the `Redis` store with the correct host and port configuration options.

## Handling Errors

Even if you've chosen the right store and initialized it correctly, errors can still occur. It's important to handle these errors appropriately to prevent your application from crashing.

```typescript
const cacheManager = require('cache-manager');
const redisStore = require('cache-manager-redis-store');
const store = redisStore;
const cache = cacheManager.caching({store, host: 'localhost', port: 6379});
cache.get('key', function(err, result) {
    if (err) {
        console.error('Error fetching from cache', err);
        return;
    }
    console.log(result);
});
```

In this code snippet, we're handling any errors that might occur when fetching data from the cache.

## Conclusion

The `TypeError: store.get is not a function` error in NestJs Cache-Manager is usually caused by using an incorrect or improperly initialized `store` object. By choosing the right type of store, initializing it correctly, and handling errors appropriately, you can prevent this error from occurring. I hope this post helps you understand and solve this error. Happy coding!
