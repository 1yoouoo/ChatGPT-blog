## Understanding Server-Side Components and React.Context

In the world of web development, Next.js 13 introduced a revolutionary feature known as Server Components. This feature allows developers to write components that are rendered on the server and sent to the client as HTML. However, when working with these server-side components, one might encounter issues related to React.Context. This blog post aims to tackle these issues and provide workable solutions.

## Common Mistakes and Errors

**Mistake 1: Not providing a value for React.Context**

One of the common mistakes developers make is not providing a value for React.Context when using server-side components. This can lead to issues as the context value will be `undefined` on the client-side.

```javascript
const MyContext = React.createContext(); // No default value provided

function MyComponent() {
  const value = React.useContext(MyContext);
  // value will be undefined on client-side
}
```

In the code snippet above, `MyContext` is created without a default value. When `MyContext` is used in `MyComponent`, the value will be `undefined` on the client-side because no value was provided for the context.

**Mistake 2: Trying to use Context in getServerSideProps**

Another common mistake is attempting to use context inside `getServerSideProps`. This function runs on the server-side only and does not have access to React components or hooks, including Context.

```javascript
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const value = React.useContext(MyContext); // This will throw an error
  // ...
}
```

In the example above, trying to use `React.useContext(MyContext)` inside `getServerSideProps` will throw an error because `getServerSideProps` does not have access to React hooks.

## How to Correctly Use React.Context with Server-Side Components

To correctly use React.Context with server-side components, you need to provide a value for the context and make sure to use it in a component that is not server-rendered or inside a useEffect hook.

```javascript
const MyContext = React.createContext('default value');

function MyComponent() {
  const value = React.useContext(MyContext);
  // value will be 'default value' on client-side
}
```

In the code above, a default value is provided when creating `MyContext`. This ensures that when `MyContext` is used in `MyComponent`, the value will not be `undefined` on the client-side.

## Passing Context Values from getServerSideProps

Since `getServerSideProps` does not have access to React hooks, you cannot directly use Context inside it. However, you can pass values from `getServerSideProps` to your component and then use these values to provide context.

```javascript
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  // Fetch some data
  const data = await fetchData();

  // Pass data to your component
  return { props: { data } };
}

function MyComponent({ data }) {
  return (
    <MyContext.Provider value={data}>
      {/* Your component code */}
    </MyContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

In the code above, data is fetched inside `getServerSideProps` and passed to `MyComponent` as a prop. This data is then used to provide a value for `MyContext`.

## Handling Context Changes on the Client-Side

When dealing with server-side components, it's important to handle context changes on the client-side. This is because server components do not re-render on the client-side, so any context changes will not trigger a re-render of server components.

```javascript
const MyContext = React.createContext('default value');

function MyComponent() {
  const value = React.useContext(MyContext);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    // Handle context change
  }, [value]);
}
```

In the code above, a `useEffect` hook is used to handle context changes. The `value` from `MyContext` is added to the dependency array of `useEffect`, so the effect will run whenever `value` changes.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, when working with server-side components in Next.js 13, it's crucial to understand how to correctly use React.Context. By avoiding common mistakes and following the best practices outlined in this post, you can effectively use Context with server-side components and build robust, dynamic web applications.

When working with **Nextjs13** and **React.Context**, it's not uncommon to encounter some issues. Particularly, you may find yourself dealing with errors related to server-side components. This blog post is aimed at helping developers in their 20s and 30s to understand and resolve these issues. 

## Understanding the Error

The error usually occurs when you're trying to use **React.Context** within a server-side component in Nextjs13. The error message might look something like this:

```javascript
Error: React.Context is not supported in Server Components.
```

This error is thrown because **React.Context** is not yet supported in server-side components in Nextjs13. 

## Why does this happen?

Before we dive into the solution, let's understand why this happens. In a typical Next.js application, server-side rendering (SSR) is used to pre-render a page on the server and send the HTML to the client. With SSR, you can use **React.Context** to share data between components.

However, with the introduction of server components in Nextjs13, this is no longer possible. Server components are rendered entirely on the server, and only the resulting HTML and minimal JavaScript are sent to the client. This means that **React.Context** cannot be used as it was with SSR.

## The Solution

Now, let's dive into the solution. The solution involves two main steps:

1. **Separating Client and Server Components**
2. **Using Props for Data Passing**

### Separating Client and Server Components

The first step is to separate your client and server components. This means that any component that uses **React.Context** should be a client component. Here's an example:

```javascript
// ClientComponent.js
import { useContext } from 'react';
import { MyContext } from './MyContext';

export default function ClientComponent() {
  const contextValue = useContext(MyContext);

  return <div>{contextValue}</div>;
}
```

In this example, `ClientComponent` is a client component that uses **React.Context** to access some data.

### Using Props for Data Passing

The second step is to pass data to server components using props instead of **React.Context**. Here's how you can do this:

```javascript
// ServerComponent.server.js
export default function ServerComponent({ data }) {
  return <div>{data}</div>;
}
```

In this example, `ServerComponent` is a server component that receives data through props.

### Bringing it All Together

Now, let's see how these two components can work together:

```javascript
// Page.js
import ClientComponent from './ClientComponent';
import ServerComponent from './ServerComponent.server';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <MyContext.Provider value="Hello, world!">
      <ClientComponent />
      <ServerComponent data="Hello, world!" />
    </MyContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

In this example, `Page` is a regular component that uses **React.Context** to provide data to `ClientComponent` and props to provide data to `ServerComponent`.

By following these steps, you can resolve the error and successfully use **React.Context** with Nextjs13 server-side components.

## Conclusion

While the introduction of server components in Nextjs13 brings a lot of benefits, it also comes with some challenges. One of these challenges is the inability to use **React.Context** within server components. However, by separating client and server components and using props for data passing, you can overcome this challenge.

Remember, the key is to understand the nature of server components and adjust your code accordingly. With a little bit of refactoring, you can make your Nextjs13 application work smoothly with **React.Context**.

Happy coding!
