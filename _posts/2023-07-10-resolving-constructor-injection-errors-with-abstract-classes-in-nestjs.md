## Introduction

When working with **NestJS**, a prevalent issue that developers often encounter is **constructor injection errors** with abstract classes. This is a common problem, especially when trying to leverage the power of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in TypeScript. In this article, we will delve into the nature of these errors, identify common mistakes, and provide solutions to resolve them.

## Understanding Constructor Injection

Before we dive into the errors, it's crucial to understand what constructor injection is. Constructor injection is a form of **dependency injection** where dependencies are provided as constructor parameters. It's a powerful feature in NestJS that enables loose coupling and enhances the testability of your application.

## The Problem with Abstract Classes

Now, where does the problem arise? The issue lies in the use of abstract classes. An abstract class in TypeScript is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, it must be extended by other classes. When we try to inject an abstract class as a dependency in NestJS, we encounter a constructor injection error.

## Common Mistakes

There are two common mistakes that often lead to these errors:

1. **Injecting Abstract Class Directly**: This is the most common mistake. As we mentioned earlier, abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly. If you try to inject an abstract class as a dependency, NestJS will throw a constructor injection error.

```typescript
@Injectable()
export abstract class AbstractClass {...}

@Injectable()
export class SomeService {
    constructor(private abstractClass: AbstractClass) {...} // This will throw an error
}
```

In the code snippet above, `AbstractClass` is injected directly, which will lead to an error since abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly.

2. **Not Providing a Custom Provider**: Another common mistake is not providing a custom provider for the abstract class. If you don't provide a custom provider, NestJS will not know how to create an instance of the abstract class.

```typescript
@Injectable()
export abstract class AbstractClass {...}

@Module({
    providers: [AbstractClass] // This will throw an error
})
export class SomeModule {}
```

In the code snippet above, `AbstractClass` is provided directly in the `providers` array. This will lead to an error since NestJS doesn't know how to create an instance of the abstract class.

## Resolving the Errors

The solution to these errors lies in providing a custom provider for the abstract class. The custom provider instructs NestJS on how to create an instance of the abstract class.

```typescript
@Injectable()
export abstract class AbstractClass {...}

@Injectable()
export class ConcreteClass extends AbstractClass {...}

@Module({
    providers: [
        {
            provide: AbstractClass,
            useClass: ConcreteClass
        }
    ]
})
export class SomeModule {}
```

In the code snippet above, we have created a custom provider for `AbstractClass`. We have instructed NestJS to use `ConcreteClass` whenever an instance of `AbstractClass` is requested.

## Understanding the Solution

Let's understand the solution in detail. 

1. **Creating a Concrete Class**: We create a concrete class (`ConcreteClass`) that extends the abstract class (`AbstractClass`). This concrete class can be instantiated and used wherever an instance of the abstract class is needed.

2. **Providing the Concrete Class**: We provide the concrete class as a custom provider in the `providers` array of the module. This instructs NestJS to use `ConcreteClass` whenever an instance of `AbstractClass` is requested.

With this setup, whenever we inject `AbstractClass` as a dependency, NestJS will create an instance of `ConcreteClass` and provide it. This resolves the constructor injection error.

## Conclusion

By understanding the nature of constructor injection errors with abstract classes in NestJS, and by identifying common mistakes, we can effectively resolve these issues. Providing a custom provider for the abstract class is the key to resolving these errors. This not only enhances the flexibility of your application but also leverages the power of OOP in TypeScript.

When dealing with **NestJS**, one common error that you might encounter is the `Constructor Injection Error` with `Abstract Classes`. This error typically arises when you are trying to inject a service into a controller, and the service is an instance of an abstract class. 

The root of this error lies in the way NestJS handles dependency injection. NestJS uses the type of the service to identify the instance that should be injected. However, when the service is an instance of an abstract class, NestJS cannot correctly identify the instance to inject, leading to the `Constructor Injection Error`.

## Step 1: Understanding the Error 

Let's start with a simple example. Consider the following `TypeScript` code:

```typescript
abstract class AbstractService {
  abstract doSomething(): void;
}

@Injectable()
class ConcreteService extends AbstractService {
  doSomething(): void {
    console.log('Doing something...');
  }
}

@Controller()
class MyController {
  constructor(private service: AbstractService) {}
}
```

In the above code, we have an abstract class `AbstractService`, a concrete class `ConcreteService` that extends `AbstractService`, and a controller `MyController` where `AbstractService` is injected. When you run this code, you will encounter the `Constructor Injection Error`.

## Step 2: Identifying the Cause

The cause of this error is that `NestJS` uses the type of the service (`AbstractService` in this case) to identify the instance that should be injected. However, since `AbstractService` is an abstract class, there is no instance of it that can be injected, leading to the error.

## Step 3: Resolving the Error

To resolve this error, you need to provide `NestJS` with a way to correctly identify the instance to inject. This can be done by using a custom provider with a `useClass` property.

## Step 4: Implementing the Solution

Let's modify the previous code to resolve the error:

```typescript
@Module({
  providers: [
    {
      provide: AbstractService,
      useClass: ConcreteService,
    },
  ],
  controllers: [MyController],
})
class AppModule {}
```

In the above code, we have added a custom provider in the `AppModule`. The provider uses the `provide` property to specify the token that will be used to identify the instance, and the `useClass` property to specify the class of the instance that should be injected.

## Step 5: Verifying the Solution

Now, if you run the code, you will see that the error has been resolved. `NestJS` can correctly identify the `ConcreteService` instance to inject into the `MyController` constructor.

## Step 6: Understanding the Solution

The key to understanding this solution is understanding how `NestJS` uses tokens to identify instances for injection. When you specify a class as a provider, `NestJS` uses the class itself as the token. However, when you use a custom provider, you can specify a different token using the `provide` property. 

In this case, we are using `AbstractService` as the token, but we are telling `NestJS` to use `ConcreteService` as the class of the instance to inject. This way, `NestJS` can correctly identify the instance to inject, even though the service is an instance of an abstract class.

## Conclusion

`Constructor Injection Errors` with `Abstract Classes` in `NestJS` can be tricky to resolve, but with a good understanding of how `NestJS` handles dependency injection, you can easily resolve these errors. Remember, the key is to provide `NestJS` with a way to correctly identify the instance to inject. And this can be done by using a custom provider with a `useClass` property.
