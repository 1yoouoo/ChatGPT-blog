Java Native Memory Tracking (NMT) is a feature that helps developers track the memory usage of their Java applications. It provides a detailed view of the JVM's memory usage, including Java heap and non-heap memory. However, enabling NMT, especially in summary mode, can sometimes lead to overhead issues. This article will delve into the common errors and mistakes related to the overhead of Java NMT in summary mode.

## **Common Errors and Mistakes**

There are two common mistakes that developers often make when using Java NMT in summary mode. The first one is **not understanding the implications of enabling NMT**. Enabling NMT can lead to a significant increase in the memory usage of the JVM, which can affect the performance of the application. 

The second common mistake is **misinterpreting the output of NMT**. The output of NMT in summary mode provides a high-level overview of the memory usage of the JVM. However, it does not provide detailed information about the memory usage of individual objects or classes. Misinterpreting this output can lead to incorrect conclusions about the memory usage of the application.

## **Understanding the Code**

Let's delve into an example to understand these errors better. Consider the following Java code:

```java
public class MemoryTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
            list.add("Item " + i);
        }
    }
}
```

In this code, we are creating a list of one million string objects. If we run this code with NMT enabled in summary mode, we might see an output like this:

```
Total: reserved=1022976KB, committed=982040KB
-                 Java Heap (reserved=524288KB, committed=524288KB)
                            (mmap: reserved=524288KB, committed=524288KB) 

-                     Class (reserved=1065025KB, committed=1052673KB)
                            (classes #13214)
                            (malloc=1325KB #1886) 
                            (mmap: reserved=1063696KB, committed=1051348KB) 

-                    Thread (reserved=12336KB, committed=12336KB)
                            (thread #12)
                            (stack: reserved=12312KB, committed=12312KB)
                            (malloc=16KB #58) 
                            (arena=8KB #22)

-                      Code (reserved=249634KB, committed=22530KB)
                            (malloc=1634KB #2695) 
                            (mmap: reserved=248000KB, committed=20896KB) 

-                        GC (reserved=78231KB, committed=77531KB)
                            (malloc=7831KB #337) 
                            (mmap: reserved=70400KB, committed=69600KB) 

-                  Compiler (reserved=132KB, committed=132KB)
                            (malloc=4KB #25) 
                            (arena=128KB #3)

-                  Internal (reserved=536870KB, committed=536870KB)
                            (malloc=536870KB #1795) 
```

From this output, we might conclude that the list of one million string objects is consuming a large amount of memory. However, this would be a misinterpretation of the output. The 'Java Heap' line in the output refers to the total memory reserved for the Java heap, not the memory used by the list of string objects. 

## **Mitigating the Overhead**

To mitigate the overhead of NMT, developers can use the `PrintNMTStatistics` option to periodically print the NMT statistics. This can help developers monitor the memory usage of their applications without incurring the overhead of having NMT enabled all the time.

```java
-XX:NativeMemoryTracking=summary -XX:+PrintNMTStatistics
```

## **Understanding the Implications of NMT**

The overhead of NMT can impact the performance of the application. Therefore, it's crucial for developers to understand the implications of enabling NMT. While NMT provides valuable insights into the memory usage of the JVM, it should be used judiciously and not as a replacement for good memory management practices.

## **Correct Interpretation of NMT Output**

Correctly interpreting the output of NMT is critical for making accurate conclusions about the memory usage of the application. Developers should understand that the output of NMT in summary mode provides a high-level overview of the memory usage of the JVM, not detailed information about the memory usage of individual objects or classes.

## **Conclusion**

When it comes to **Java Native Memory Tracking** (NMT) in Summary Mode, there are a few common errors that developers often encounter. One of the most frequent issues is the overhead that can occur when using this feature. This blog post aims to provide a comprehensive guide on how to handle and resolve these errors. 

## Overview of the Error

In Java, NMT is a feature that tracks internal memory usage in the JVM. It can be a powerful tool for identifying memory leaks and other issues. However, when used in summary mode, NMT can cause significant overhead, leading to performance issues and errors.

## The Cause of the Error

The overhead is primarily caused by the additional processing required to track memory usage. This can lead to increased CPU usage and slower performance. In some cases, it can even cause the JVM to crash, leading to a frustrating experience for developers.

## Identifying the Error

Before we can resolve the error, we need to identify it. The first step is to check the JVM logs. If you see messages indicating high CPU usage or slow performance, this could be a sign that NMT is causing overhead. 

```javascript
// Example log message
console.log("Warning: High CPU usage detected, possible memory tracking overhead");
```

In this example, the log message is a warning about high CPU usage, which could be a sign of memory tracking overhead.

## Resolving the Error

Resolving the error involves reducing the overhead caused by NMT. This can be done in several ways:

1. **Disable NMT**: The simplest solution is to disable NMT if it's not needed. This can be done by removing the `-XX:NativeMemoryTracking=summary` option from the JVM startup command.

```javascript
// Example command to start JVM without NMT
java -jar myApp.jar
```

In this example, the JVM is started without the NMT option, effectively disabling it.

2. **Use NMT in Detail Mode**: If you still need to track memory usage, consider using NMT in detail mode instead. This mode provides more detailed information, but with less overhead. This can be done by replacing the `-XX:NativeMemoryTracking=summary` option with `-XX:NativeMemoryTracking=detail`.

```javascript
// Example command to start JVM with NMT in detail mode
java -XX:NativeMemoryTracking=detail -jar myApp.jar
```

In this example, the JVM is started with the NMT option set to detail mode.

3. **Increase JVM Memory**: If disabling or changing the mode of NMT is not an option, consider increasing the memory allocated to the JVM. This can help accommodate the additional processing required by NMT.

```javascript
// Example command to start JVM with increased memory
java -Xmx1024m -XX:NativeMemoryTracking=summary -jar myApp.jar
```

In this example, the JVM is started with 1GB of memory, which may help reduce the overhead caused by NMT.

## Conclusion

Java Native Memory Tracking is a powerful tool for identifying memory issues in your applications. However, when used in summary mode, it can cause significant overhead, leading to performance issues and errors. By understanding how to identify and resolve these issues, you can use NMT effectively without impacting the performance of your applications.
