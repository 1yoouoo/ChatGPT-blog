In this blog post, we'll be delving into the intricate world of **Next.js 13**, specifically focusing on the common issues developers face with *query params* in the server component. We'll be exploring the root causes of these issues and providing practical solutions to resolve them.

## The Root of the Problem

The first common mistake that developers often make is **not properly passing the query parameters** to the server component. This is typically due to a misunderstanding of how Next.js handles query parameters.

Here's a simple example:

```javascript
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'

export default function Page() {
  const router = useRouter()
  const { query } = router

  return <div>{query.param}</div>
}
```

In this code snippet, we're trying to access a query parameter called 'param'. However, this will not work in a server component in Next.js 13 because the `useRouter` hook is not available in server components. 

## The Solution: Using getServerSideProps

To access the query parameters in a server component, we should use the `getServerSideProps` function instead. 

```javascript
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const { query } = context
  return { props: { query } }
}

export default function Page({ query }) {
  return <div>{query.param}</div>
}
```

In this code, we're exporting an async function `getServerSideProps` that receives a context object. This context object contains various properties, including the query object that we're interested in. We then pass this query object as a prop to our Page component, which allows us to access the query parameters.

## The Second Common Mistake: Misunderstanding the Query Object

Another common mistake is misunderstanding the structure of the query object. The query object is a plain JavaScript object that Next.js provides, which contains the parsed query string. 

```javascript
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const { query } = context
  console.log(query) // { param: 'value' }
  return { props: { query } }
}
```

In this example, we're logging the query object to the console. If our URL was '/page?param=value', we would see `{ param: 'value' }` in the console. This shows us that the query object is a key-value pair representation of the query string.

## The Solution: Properly Accessing Query Params

To correctly access the query parameters, we need to understand that they are properties of the query object. 

```javascript
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const { query } = context
  const { param } = query
  console.log(param) // 'value'
  return { props: { param } }
}

export default function Page({ param }) {
  return <div>{param}</div>
}
```

In this code, we're destructuring the param property from the query object and logging it to the console. We then pass this param as a prop to our Page component. This allows us to correctly access and display the query parameter.

## A Word on URL Encoding

It's also worth mentioning that query parameters are often URL-encoded. This means that certain characters are replaced with a '%' followed by two hexadecimal digits. For example, a space is replaced with '%20'. 

## Decoding Query Params

To handle URL-encoded query parameters, we can use the built-in JavaScript function `decodeURIComponent`.

```javascript
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const { query } = context
  const { param } = query
  const decodedParam = decodeURIComponent(param)
  console.log(decodedParam) // 'value with spaces'
  return { props: { param: decodedParam } }
}

export default function Page({ param }) {
  return <div>{param}</div>
}
```

In this code, we're using `decodeURIComponent` to decode the param query parameter before passing it as a prop to our Page component. This ensures that any URL-encoded characters are correctly decoded.

## In Summary

To start with, let's understand what this error is all about. In Next.js 13, the server component is a new feature that allows you to write server-side code directly in your components. This is a powerful feature that can greatly simplify your code and make it easier to manage. However, it also introduces some new challenges, one of which is handling query params.

Query params, as you may know, are the parameters that you pass in the URL of a request. For example, if you have a URL like `http://example.com/?param=value`, `param` is the query param and `value` is its value. In Next.js, you can access these params through the `context.query` object in your server component.

The issue arises when you try to use these query params in your server component. The problem is that the server component does not have access to the `context.query` object, so if you try to use it, you will get an error.

Let's take a look at an example. Suppose you have a server component like this:

```javascript
import {useContext} from 'react'
import {ServerComponentContext} from 'next/server-component'

function MyServerComponent() {
  const context = useContext(ServerComponentContext)
  const paramValue = context.query.param
  return <div>{paramValue}</div>
}

export default MyServerComponent
```

In this example, we are trying to access the value of the query param `param` through the `context.query` object. However, this will throw an error because the server component does not have access to `context.query`.

So, how do we resolve this issue? The solution is to pass the query params as props to the server component. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
import {useContext} from 'react'
import {ServerComponentContext} from 'next/server-component'

function MyServerComponent({param}) {
  return <div>{param}</div>
}

export async function getServerComponentProps(context) {
  return {param: context.query.param}
}

export default MyServerComponent
```

In this example, we are using the `getServerComponentProps` function to fetch the query params and pass them as props to the server component. Now, the server component can access the query params through its props.

This solution works, but it requires you to manually fetch the query params and pass them as props. This can be tedious and error-prone, especially if you have many query params.

To make this process easier, you can create a helper function that automatically fetches all query params and passes them as props:

```javascript
export async function getServerComponentProps(context) {
  return {...context.query}
}
```

With this helper function, you don't need to manually fetch each query param. Instead, all query params will be automatically fetched and passed as props.

In conclusion, handling query params with server components in Next.js 13 can be tricky, but with a proper understanding and a systematic approach, it can be effectively handled. Remember, the key is to pass the query params as props to the server component, and use a helper function to simplify the process. Happy coding!
