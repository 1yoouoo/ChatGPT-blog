## Understanding the getState() Function Error in Cypress Tests

When writing tests in Cypress, you may have encountered an issue where the getState() function always returns the initialState. This is a common problem that many developers face when working with Cypress. The getState() function is used to access the current state of the Redux store. However, when it constantly returns the initialState, it can make it difficult to write effective tests.

There are a few reasons why you might be experiencing this issue. Two common mistakes include not correctly setting up your store or not properly using the getState() function.

**Mistake 1: Not Correctly Setting Up Your Store**

If your store is not set up correctly, the getState() function will not be able to access the current state and will default to returning the initialState. This can happen if you did not correctly import your store or if you did not correctly define your reducers.

For instance, consider the following example in JavaScript:

```javascript
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import rootReducer from './reducers';

const store = createStore(rootReducer);
```

In this example, we're creating a store using the createStore() function from Redux and passing in our rootReducer. If the rootReducer is not correctly defined or if it's not correctly imported, the store will not be set up properly, and the getState() function will always return the initialState.

**Mistake 2: Not Properly Using the getState() Function**

Another common mistake is not properly using the getState() function. The getState() function is a function of the store and needs to be called as such.

For example, consider the following TypeScript code:

```typescript
const state = store.getState();
```

In this example, we're calling the getState() function on the store. If you're not calling the getState() function on the store, it will not be able to access the current state and will default to returning the initialState.

## How to Resolve the getState() Function Error

Resolving the getState() function error involves correcting these common mistakes. First, you need to ensure that your store is correctly set up. Check that your rootReducer is correctly defined and that it's correctly imported. You can do this by checking the console for any errors related to your rootReducer or your store.

Second, you need to ensure that you're properly using the getState() function. Make sure that you're calling the getState() function on the store and not on any other object.

For instance, the following TypeScript code correctly uses the getState() function:

```typescript
const state = store.getState();
```

In this example, we're correctly calling the getState() function on the store, which allows us to access the current state.

## Wrapping Up

In conclusion, the Cypress getState() function error where it always returns the initialState is a common issue that many developers face. By ensuring that your store is correctly set up and that you're properly using the getState() function, you can resolve this issue and write effective tests in Cypress.

If you are a developer who uses **Cypress** for end-to-end testing in your applications, you might have come across a common but puzzling error: the `getState()` function always returns the `initialState` in Cypress tests. This error can be frustrating, especially when your tests depend heavily on the state management of your application.

In this blog post, we will delve into the root cause of this issue and provide a step-by-step solution to resolve it. We will also provide code snippets in JavaScript and TypeScript to help illustrate the problem and its solution more clearly.

## Understanding the Problem

Before we dive into the solution, it's essential to understand why this error occurs. Cypress runs in the same run loop as your application. However, it operates outside of the context of your application. This means that when you call `getState()` in your Cypress tests, it doesn't have access to the current state of your application. Instead, it returns the `initialState` because that's what is available to it.

```javascript
// Cypress test
it('returns initialState', () => {
  cy.window().its('store').invoke('getState').should('deep.equal', initialState)
})
```

In the above example, even though you might have dispatched actions that should have changed the state of your application, `getState()` still returns the `initialState`.

## The Solution

Now that we understand the problem, let's go through the steps to resolve it.

**Step 1: Access the Application Window**

The first step is to access the window object of your application from your Cypress test. This can be done using the `cy.window()` command.

```javascript
cy.window().then((win) => {
  // win is the window object of your application
})
```

**Step 2: Access the Store**

The next step is to access the store of your application. Depending on how you have set up your application, this could be done in different ways. In most cases, you would have attached your store to the window object of your application, and you can access it as shown below.

```javascript
cy.window().then((win) => {
  const store = win.store
})
```

**Step 3: Dispatch an Action**

Now that you have access to the store, you can dispatch an action. This action should change the state of your application in a way that you can assert in your test.

```javascript
cy.window().then((win) => {
  const store = win.store
  store.dispatch({ type: 'ACTION_TYPE', payload: 'payload' })
})
```

**Step 4: Assert the New State**

Finally, you can assert that the state of your application has changed as expected. You can do this by calling `getState()` on your store and checking that it equals the new state.

```javascript
cy.window().then((win) => {
  const store = win.store
  store.dispatch({ type: 'ACTION_TYPE', payload: 'payload' })
  expect(store.getState()).to.deep.equal(newState)
})
```

## Conclusion

In this post, we have looked at why the `getState()` function always returns the `initialState` in Cypress tests and how to resolve this issue. By accessing the window object of your application, accessing the store, dispatching an action, and asserting the new state, you can ensure that your Cypress tests accurately reflect the state of your application.

Remember, the key to resolving this issue is understanding that Cypress operates outside the context of your application. Therefore, you need to explicitly access the application context from your Cypress tests. Once you understand this, resolving the `getState()` error becomes straightforward.
