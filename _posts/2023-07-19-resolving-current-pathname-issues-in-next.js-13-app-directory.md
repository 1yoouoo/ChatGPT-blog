**Next.js** is a powerful JavaScript framework that allows developers to build server-side rendering and static web applications. However, with the advent of Next.js 13, many developers have been facing issues related to the current pathname in their application directory. This article aims to provide a comprehensive guide on how to resolve these issues.

## Common Mistakes Leading to Pathname Issues

The first common mistake is **incorrectly referencing static files**. In Next.js, static files should be stored inside the `public` directory, and they should be referenced from the root of the project. If you are referencing them from a different directory, you might encounter pathname issues.

```javascript
// Incorrect
import Image from '../public/my-image.jpg';

// Correct
import Image from '/my-image.jpg';
```

In the incorrect example, the image is being imported from the `public` directory, which is not the correct way to reference static files in Next.js. In the correct example, the image is being imported from the root of the project, which is the correct way to reference static files.

The second common mistake is **not using the `Link` component correctly**. The `Link` component is a built-in component in Next.js used for client-side transitions between routes. If you are not using it correctly, you might encounter pathname issues.

```javascript
// Incorrect
<Link href="about">

// Correct
<Link href="/about">
```

In the incorrect example, the `Link` component is being used to navigate to the `about` page, but the href does not start with a slash. In the correct example, the href starts with a slash, which is the correct way to use the `Link` component.

## Utilizing Next.js Router

The **Next.js Router** is a powerful tool that allows you to manipulate the URL in your Next.js applications. You can use it to get the current pathname, navigate between pages, and more.

```javascript
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function MyComponent() {
  const router = useRouter();
  console.log(router.pathname);
}
```

In this example, the `useRouter` hook from Next.js is being used to get a reference to the router. The `pathname` property of the router object is then logged to the console, which will display the current pathname.

## Using Dynamic Routes

Next.js also supports **dynamic routes**, which allow you to create pages that have dynamic parts in their path. This can be useful if you are building a blog, an e-commerce site, or any other type of application that requires dynamic URLs.

```javascript
// pages/posts/[id].js

function Post({ post }) {
  // Render post...
}

Post.getInitialProps = async ({ query }) => {
  const { id } = query;
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.mywebsite.com/posts/${id}`);
  const post = await res.json();

  return { post };
};

export default Post;
```

In this example, a dynamic route is being used to display individual posts. The `getInitialProps` function is used to fetch the data for the post based on the `id` in the URL.

## Handling 404 Errors

When a user navigates to a page that does not exist, it's important to show a **404 error page**. Next.js has built-in support for custom 404 pages.

```javascript
// pages/404.js

export default function Custom404() {
  return <h1>404 - Page Not Found</h1>
}
```

In this example, a custom 404 page is being created. Whenever a user navigates to a page that does not exist, this 404 page will be displayed.

## Conclusion

If you're a developer who uses **Next.js**, you might have run into an issue where the current pathname isn't recognized correctly, particularly in the latest version, Next.js 13. This can cause a range of problems, from components not rendering correctly to outright crashes. But don't worry, we've got you covered. This blog post will guide you through a step-by-step solution to this error.

Firstly, let's understand the nature of the problem. The issue arises when the Next.js router's `pathname` property doesn't match the actual current path. This could be due to a variety of reasons, but the most common one is that the app directory structure doesn't match the expected format. 

Let's say you have a directory structure like this:

```javascript
- pages
  - index.js
  - about.js
  - blog
    - [id].js
```

In this case, the `pathname` for the `blog` page would be `/blog/[id]`. However, if your directory structure doesn't match this format, the `pathname` might not be recognized correctly.

Now, let's dive into the solution. The first step is to ensure that your directory structure matches the expected format. This means that each page should have its own `.js` file in the `pages` directory, and any dynamic routes should be nested within their own directories.

```javascript
- pages
  - index.js
  - about.js
  - blog
    - [id].js
  - contact.js
```

In the above structure, the `pathname` for each page will be recognized correctly. For example, the `pathname` for the `contact` page will be `/contact`.

The second step is to ensure that you're using the `next/router` module correctly. This module provides the `useRouter` hook, which you can use to access the `pathname` property. Here's an example of how to use it:

```javascript
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'

export default function Page() {
  const router = useRouter()
  const { pathname } = router

  return <div>Current pathname: {pathname}</div>
}
```

In this example, the `pathname` is extracted from the router object and displayed in a `div`. If the current pathname isn't recognized correctly, this `div` will display the wrong value.

The third step is to ensure that you're navigating between pages correctly. Next.js provides the `Link` component for this purpose. Here's an example of how to use it:

```javascript
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Navigation() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <Link href="/">Home</Link>
      <Link href="/about">About</Link>
      <Link href="/blog/[id]" as="/blog/1">Blog</Link>
    </nav>
  )
}
```

In this example, the `Link` component is used to navigate between the `home`, `about`, and `blog` pages. The `as` prop is used to provide the actual URL for the dynamic `blog` route.

The fourth step is to handle any errors that might occur when navigating between pages. You can do this by wrapping your `Link` components in a `try/catch` block:

```javascript
import Link from 'next/link'

export default function Navigation() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <Link href="/">Home</Link>
      <Link href="/about">About</Link>
      <Link href="/blog/[id]" as="/blog/1">Blog</Link>
    </nav>
  )
}
```

In this example, if an error occurs when navigating to the `blog` page, the error will be caught and logged to the console. This can help you identify any issues with your `pathname`.

The fifth and final step is to ensure that your `next.config.js` file is configured correctly. This file controls various aspects of your Next.js app, including the routing system. Here's an example of a correctly configured `next.config.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  trailingSlash: true,
  target: 'serverless'
}
```

In this example, `reactStrictMode` is set to `true` to enforce best practices, `trailingSlash` is set to `true` to add a slash to the end of each URL, and `target` is set to `serverless` to enable serverless deployment.

By following these five steps, you should be able to resolve any issues with the current pathname not being recognized correctly in your Next.js 13 app directory. Remember, the key is to ensure that your directory structure, routing system, and `next.config.js` file are all configured correctly. Happy coding!
