## Understanding the 'Persisted Queries Enabled Using Unbounded Cache' Error

The 'Persisted Queries Enabled Using Unbounded Cache' error is a common issue that developers encounter when deploying their NestJS applications in a production environment. This error is often due to a misconfiguration in the caching strategy used in the application. Before we delve into the solution, let's first understand what the error message implies.

## What does 'Persisted Queries Enabled Using Unbounded Cache' Mean?

In the context of NestJS, a *persisted query* refers to a query that has been saved on the server side for future use. This is typically done to improve the efficiency of the application by reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted between the client and the server.

The term *unbounded cache* refers to a cache that has no maximum size limit. This can be problematic because it means that the cache can grow indefinitely, potentially consuming all available memory and causing the application to crash.

## Common Mistakes Leading to the Error

There are two common mistakes that can lead to the 'Persisted Queries Enabled Using Unbounded Cache' error:

1. **Misconfiguration of the Cache:** If the cache is not properly configured, it can lead to an unbounded cache scenario. This typically happens when a maximum size limit is not set for the cache.

2. **Inappropriate Use of Persisted Queries:** Persisted queries should be used judiciously. Overusing persisted queries can fill up the cache quickly, leading to an unbounded cache situation.

## The Solution: Configuring the Cache Properly

To solve the 'Persisted Queries Enabled Using Unbounded Cache' error, you need to properly configure the cache in your NestJS application. This can be done by setting a maximum size limit for the cache. Here's how you can do it using TypeScript:

```typescript
import { CacheModule } from '@nestjs/common';
import * as redisStore from 'cache-manager-redis-store';

@Module({
  imports: [
    CacheModule.register({
      store: redisStore,
      host: 'localhost',
      port: 6379,
      ttl: 60, // Time to live in seconds
      max: 10, // Maximum number of items in the cache
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

In the above code, we are using the `CacheModule.register` method to configure the cache. We are setting the `store` to `redisStore`, which means we are using Redis as our caching solution. The `host` and `port` options are set to the default Redis host and port respectively. The `ttl` option is set to 60 seconds, which means that each item in the cache will expire after 60 seconds. The `max` option is set to 10, which means that the cache can hold a maximum of 10 items at a time.

## Using Persisted Queries Judiciously

Another important part of solving the 'Persisted Queries Enabled Using Unbounded Cache' error is to use persisted queries judiciously. This means that you should only persist queries that are frequently used and are relatively static in nature. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```typescript
import { Query, Resolver } from '@nestjs/graphql';

@Resolver()
export class ExampleResolver {
  @Query({ persist: true })
  frequentlyUsedQuery() {
    // Implementation of the query
  }

  @Query({ persist: false })
  rarelyUsedQuery() {
    // Implementation of the query
  }
}
```

In the above code, we have two GraphQL queries. The `frequentlyUsedQuery` is marked with `{ persist: true }`, which means that it will be persisted on the server side. The `rarelyUsedQuery` is marked with `{ persist: false }`, which means that it will not be persisted. By doing this, we can ensure that only the necessary queries are persisted, thus preventing the cache from filling up quickly.

## Monitoring the Cache

It's also important to monitor the cache regularly to ensure that it's not filling up too quickly. This can be done using various tools such as the Redis CLI. Regular monitoring can help detect potential issues early and prevent the 'Persisted Queries Enabled Using Unbounded Cache' error from occurring.

## Conclusion

When it comes to working with **Nestjs** in a production environment, one common error that developers often encounter is the `'Persisted Queries Enabled Using Unbounded Cache'` error. This error can be quite perplexing, especially for developers who are new to the Nestjs environment. However, with a clear understanding of the issue and a step-by-step approach to resolving it, you can easily overcome this error. 

## Understanding the Error

Before we dive into the solution, it's important to understand what this error means. The `'Persisted Queries Enabled Using Unbounded Cache'` error typically arises when you have enabled persisted queries in your Nestjs application but are using an unbounded cache to store these queries. This can lead to memory leaks and other performance issues, especially in a production environment.

## Step 1: Identifying the Issue

The first step in resolving this error is to identify where the issue is coming from. This can usually be done by inspecting your application's logs or error messages. Look for any mentions of `'Persisted Queries Enabled Using Unbounded Cache'` or related terms.

```javascript
// example of an error log
console.error('Persisted Queries Enabled Using Unbounded Cache');
```

In the above example, we're simply logging the error message to the console. This is a good starting point for identifying the issue, but you'll likely need to dig a bit deeper to find the root cause.

## Step 2: Inspecting Your Cache Configuration

Once you've identified the issue, the next step is to inspect your cache configuration. This is where you've defined how your application should store and retrieve persisted queries.

```typescript
// example of a cache configuration in Nestjs
import { CacheModule } from '@nestjs/common';

@Module({
  imports: [
    CacheModule.register({
      ttl: 5, // seconds
      max: 10, // maximum number of items in cache
    }),
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

In the above example, we're using the `CacheModule` from Nestjs to configure our cache. We've set a `ttl` (time to live) of 5 seconds and a maximum of 10 items in the cache. If your configuration doesn't have a `max` value, this could be the source of your error.

## Step 3: Setting a Bound on Your Cache

If you've determined that your cache is unbounded, the solution is to set a bound on it. This can be done by adding a `max` value to your cache configuration.

```typescript
// example of setting a bound on your cache
CacheModule.register({
  ttl: 5, // seconds
  max: 100, // maximum number of items in cache
});
```

In the above example, we've set a `max` value of 100. This means that our cache will never store more than 100 items at a time. If more items are added, the oldest items will be removed to make room for the new ones.

## Step 4: Testing Your Solution

After you've updated your cache configuration, the next step is to test your solution. This can be done by running your application and checking to see if the error still occurs.

```javascript
// example of testing your solution
console.log('Testing cache configuration...');
```

In the above example, we're simply logging a message to the console to indicate that we're testing our cache configuration. You'll likely want to perform more thorough testing to ensure that your solution works as expected.

## Step 5: Monitoring Your Application

The final step in resolving this error is to monitor your application to ensure that the issue doesn't reoccur. This can be done by regularly checking your application's logs and performance metrics.

```javascript
// example of monitoring your application
console.log('Monitoring application...');
```

In the above example, we're simply logging a message to the console to indicate that we're monitoring our application. You'll likely want to use more sophisticated monitoring tools to keep an eye on your application's performance.

## Conclusion

Solving the `'Persisted Queries Enabled Using Unbounded Cache'` error in Nestjs production can be a daunting task, especially for developers who are new to the environment. However, with a clear understanding of the issue and a step-by-step approach to resolving it, you can easily overcome this error. Remember to always set a bound on your cache to prevent memory leaks and other performance issues. Happy coding!
