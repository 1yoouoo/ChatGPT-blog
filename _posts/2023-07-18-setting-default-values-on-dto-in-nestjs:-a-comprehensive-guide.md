## Understanding the Problem

If you are a developer working with **NestJs**, you might have come across a situation where you need to set default values on **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**. This blog post aims to provide a comprehensive guide on how to do this effectively and efficiently.

## The Importance of Default Values

Firstly, it's essential to understand why setting default values on DTOs is important. Default values can help to prevent errors or exceptions in your code when an object is instantiated without certain values. They also provide a way to ensure that your objects are always in a valid state, thereby improving the overall robustness of your application.

## Common Mistakes

There are two common mistakes that developers often make when trying to set default values on DTOs in NestJs. 

1. **Not setting default values at all:** This can lead to `undefined` or `null` errors when you try to access properties that have not been initialized.

2. **Setting default values in the wrong place:** Some developers try to set default values in the service or controller, but this can lead to code duplication and increased complexity.

## Setting Default Values in DTOs

The best place to set default values is directly in the DTO. This ensures that the default values are always used whenever a new instance of the DTO is created. Here's a simple example in TypeScript:

```typescript
export class CreateCatDto {
  name: string = 'Default Cat';
  age: number = 0;
  breed: string = 'Unknown';
}
```

In this code, we're creating a `CreateCatDto` class with three properties: `name`, `age`, and `breed`. Each of these properties has a default value.

## Understanding the Code

In the above example, we're using TypeScript's class property initializer feature to set default values for each property. This is a powerful feature that allows you to ensure that your objects are always in a valid state.

When a new instance of `CreateCatDto` is created, each property will automatically be initialized with its default value. This means that you don't have to worry about `undefined` or `null` errors when you try to access these properties.

## Using Default Values

To use these default values, you simply create a new instance of `CreateCatDto` without passing any arguments to the constructor:

```typescript
const cat = new CreateCatDto();
console.log(cat.name); // Default Cat
console.log(cat.age); // 0
console.log(cat.breed); // Unknown
```

Even though we didn't pass any arguments to the `CreateCatDto` constructor, each property was automatically initialized with its default value.

## Overriding Default Values

Of course, you can also override these default values by passing arguments to the `CreateCatDto` constructor:

```typescript
const cat = new CreateCatDto();
cat.name = 'Felix';
cat.age = 3;
cat.breed = 'Tabby';
console.log(cat.name); // Felix
console.log(cat.age); // 3
console.log(cat.breed); // Tabby
```

In this example, we're overriding the default values for `name`, `age`, and `breed` by setting new values on the `cat` object.

## Conclusion

Setting default values on DTOs in NestJs is a powerful way to ensure that your objects are always in a valid state. By understanding and avoiding common mistakes, and by using TypeScript's class property initializer feature, you can improve the robustness of your application and make your code easier to understand and maintain.

When it comes to software development, error handling is a critical aspect that every developer should be well-versed in. One common error that many developers encounter in NestJs is setting default values on Data Transfer Objects (DTOs). In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the specifics of this error and provide a detailed, step-by-step solution to resolve it. 

## Understanding the Error

Before we proceed to the solution, it's essential to understand the error at hand. When working with NestJs, developers often need to set default values on DTOs. This is typically done using decorators provided by the `class-validator` package. However, sometimes, despite setting the default values correctly, they do not reflect when the DTO is instantiated. This can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs in your application.

## The Solution

To resolve this error, we need to take a few steps. Let's go through them one by one.

### Step 1: Install the Required Packages

Firstly, we need to ensure that we have the `class-validator` and `class-transformer` packages installed in our NestJs project. These packages provide the decorators we need to set default values on our DTOs. You can install them using the following command:

```javascript
npm install class-validator class-transformer
```

### Step 2: Import the Required Decorators

Next, we need to import the `IsOptional` and `Default` decorators from the `class-validator` package and the `Transform` decorator from the `class-transformer` package. These decorators will be used to set the default values on our DTO.

```typescript
import { IsOptional, Default } from 'class-validator';
import { Transform } from 'class-transformer';
```

### Step 3: Set Default Values on DTO

Now, we can set the default values on our DTO. Let's say we have a `CreateUserDto` and we want to set a default value for the `role` property. Here's how we can do it:

```typescript
class CreateUserDto {
  @IsOptional()
  @Default('user')
  @Transform(({ value }) => value ?? 'user')
  role: string;
}
```

In the above code, the `@IsOptional()` decorator makes the `role` property optional. The `@Default('user')` decorator sets the default value of `role` to 'user'. Finally, the `@Transform(({ value }) => value ?? 'user')` decorator ensures that if the `role` property is not provided or is `null`, it gets the default value 'user'.

### Step 4: Use the DTO

Finally, we can use our DTO in our controller. When creating a new user, if the `role` property is not provided, it will automatically get the default value 'user'.

```typescript
import { Body, Post } from '@nestjs/common';
import { CreateUserDto } from './create-user.dto';

@Controller('users')
export class UsersController {
  @Post()
  create(@Body() createUserDto: CreateUserDto) {
    // createUserDto.role will be 'user' if not provided
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Setting default values on DTOs in NestJs can be a bit tricky, but with the right understanding and approach, it can be done effectively. The key is to use the right decorators from the `class-validator` and `class-transformer` packages and to ensure that they are used correctly. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you should be able to resolve this error and set default values on your DTOs successfully. Happy coding!
