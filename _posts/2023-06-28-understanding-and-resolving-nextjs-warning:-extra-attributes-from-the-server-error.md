## Introduction

NextJS, a popular framework for React, provides a robust platform for building server-side rendered and static web applications. While it's generally a joy to work with, you may occasionally encounter some warnings or errors that can be a bit baffling. One such warning is the `Extra attributes from the server` error. This post aims to demystify this warning, explore its common causes, and provide a step-by-step guide to resolving it.

## Why the Warning?

**NextJS** uses a reconciliation process to ensure the server-rendered HTML matches the client-side rendered HTML. This process involves comparing the two versions and updating the DOM to reflect the client-side version. If there are extra attributes in the server-rendered HTML that aren't present in the client-rendered version, NextJS throws the `Extra attributes from the server` warning.

## Common Mistakes

This warning often arises due to two common mistakes:

1. **Inconsistent use of attributes**: If an attribute is used in the server-rendered version of a component but not in the client-rendered version, NextJS will throw this warning. This could happen if, for example, you're conditionally rendering an attribute based on some state or prop that differs between the server and the client.

2. **Use of non-standard HTML attributes**: HTML has a specific set of standard attributes. If you use a non-standard attribute in your server-rendered HTML, NextJS will not recognize it and throw the warning.

## Example

Let's look at an example to better understand these mistakes. Consider the following NextJS component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = ({ isServer }) => (
  <div server={isServer.toString()}>Hello, NextJS!</div>
);

export default MyComponent;
```

In this component, we're using a non-standard `server` attribute on a `div` element. The value of this attribute is determined by the `isServer` prop. If `isServer` is `true` on the server but `false` on the client, this will result in extra attributes in the server-rendered HTML, triggering the warning.

## Resolving the Warning

To resolve the `Extra attributes from the server` warning, we need to ensure consistency between the server and client-rendered versions of our components. This involves:

1. **Avoiding the use of non-standard HTML attributes**: Stick to the standard attributes defined in the HTML specification. If you need to store extra information on an element, consider using `data-*` attributes.

2. **Ensuring attribute usage is consistent between server and client versions**: Avoid conditionally rendering attributes based on state or props that may differ between the server and the client.

## Refactored Example

Applying these principles, we can refactor our example component as follows:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => (
  <div data-server="true">Hello, NextJS!</div>
);

export default MyComponent;
```

In this refactored version, we've replaced the non-standard `server` attribute with a `data-*` attribute. We've also removed the conditional rendering of the attribute, ensuring its usage is consistent between the server and client-rendered versions.

## Conclusion

Understanding and resolving the `Extra attributes from the server` warning in NextJS can be a bit tricky, especially if you're new to the framework. However, by understanding the reconciliation process, being aware of the common mistakes that lead to this warning, and following the principles of consistent attribute usage and adherence to standard HTML attributes, you can resolve this warning and ensure a smoother development experience with NextJS.

If you're a developer who has been working with **NextJS**, chances are you've come across the warning: *Extra attributes from the server* error. This warning can be frustrating and confusing, but don't worry, we're going to break it down and solve it step by step.

## The Error

The extra attributes from the server error occurs when the server-side rendered markup and the client-side markup do not match. This inconsistency can cause issues with your application, and NextJS throws this warning to alert you.

## Understanding the Error

To understand this error, let's consider an example. Suppose you have a component that renders a div with a class name. On the server, the class name is rendered, but on the client, it's not. Here's what that might look like:

```jsx
// Server
<div className="myClass">Hello, world!</div>

// Client
<div>Hello, world!</div>
```

In this case, NextJS would throw a warning because the server and client markup do not match. The server has an extra attribute, `className`, that the client does not.

## Why does this error occur?

This error occurs due to a discrepancy between the server and client rendering. This discrepancy could be due to several reasons, such as conditional rendering based on window size or user agent, which are not available on the server, or due to asynchronous data fetching that completes after the server has rendered the page.

## How to Resolve the Error

Resolving this error involves ensuring that the server and client render the same markup. The solution will depend on the specific cause of the discrepancy. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this error:

1. **Identify the component causing the error:** The first step is to identify which component is causing the discrepancy. You can do this by checking the console for the error message, which should include the data-reactid of the offending component.

2. **Check for conditional rendering:** Once you've identified the component, check if it includes any conditional rendering based on properties that are not available on the server, such as window size or user agent. If it does, you'll need to adjust the code to ensure that the server and client render the same markup.

   Here's an example:

```jsx
// Before
<div className={window.innerWidth > 600 ? 'large' : 'small'}>Hello, world!</div>

// After
<div className={typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.innerWidth > 600 ? 'large' : 'small'}>Hello, world!</div>
```

3. **Check for asynchronous data fetching:** If the component does not include conditional rendering, check if it fetches data asynchronously. If it does, you'll need to ensure that the data is fetched before the server renders the page.

   Here's how you can do that with NextJS's `getServerSideProps`:

```jsx
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://.../data`)
  const data = await res.json()

  if (!data) {
    return {
      notFound: true,
    }
  }

  return {
    props: { data }, // will be passed to the page component as props
  }
}
```

4. **Check for other differences:** If the component does not include conditional rendering or asynchronous data fetching, check for other differences between the server and client markup. This could be anything from a typo in the class name to a missing attribute.

Once you've identified and resolved the cause of the discrepancy, the error should be resolved. Remember, the key is to ensure that the server and client render the same markup.

## Conclusion

The *Extra attributes from the server* warning in NextJS can be frustrating, but with a little sleuthing, you can identify and resolve the cause of the discrepancy. Remember, the key is to ensure that the server and client render the same markup.

I hope this post was helpful in understanding and resolving this error. Happy coding!
