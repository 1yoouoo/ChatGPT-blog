## Subheading: Unraveling the Mysteries Behind Build Failures in React Native Android

React Native is a popular framework that allows developers to build mobile applications using JavaScript and React. However, with the recent release of **React Native version 0.71.0-rc.0**, some developers have reported encountering build failures specifically for Android. In this blog post, we will delve into the details of these issues and provide comprehensive solutions to resolve them.

### Common Mistake 1: Incorrect Gradle Configuration

One common mistake that leads to build failures is an incorrect Gradle configuration. This is often due to outdated or incompatible versions of Gradle or the Android Gradle Plugin.

Here's an example of a typical `build.gradle` file:

```javascript
apply plugin: "com.android.application"

android {
    compileSdkVersion 28
    buildToolsVersion "28.0.3"

    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.example.app"
        minSdkVersion 16
        targetSdkVersion 28
        versionCode 1
        versionName "1.0"
    }
}
```

In this example, the `compileSdkVersion` and `buildToolsVersion` might not be compatible with the latest React Native version. To fix this, you might need to update these versions to match the versions recommended by the React Native documentation.

### Common Mistake 2: Dependency Conflicts

Another common issue is conflicts between dependencies. This usually occurs when two or more libraries depend on different versions of the same dependency.

Here's an example of how a `build.gradle` file might look with conflicting dependencies:

```javascript
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.facebook.react:react-native:+'
    implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-base:16.1.0'
    implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps:16.1.0'
}
```

In this example, both `play-services-base` and `play-services-maps` depend on different versions of the same Google Play Services library. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and build failures.

### Solution: Resolving Dependency Conflicts

To resolve dependency conflicts, you can use the `resolutionStrategy` feature of Gradle to force all dependencies to use a specific version of a library.

Here's an example of how to use `resolutionStrategy`:

```javascript
configurations.all {
    resolutionStrategy {
        force 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-base:16.1.0'
        force 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps:16.1.0'
    }
}
```

In this example, all dependencies are forced to use version `16.1.0` of both `play-services-base` and `play-services-maps`.

### Common Mistake 3: Incompatible Java Version

React Native Android requires a specific version of Java. If you're using a version that's too new or too old, you might encounter build failures.

Here's how to check your Java version:

```bash
java -version
```

If your Java version is not compatible with React Native Android, you'll need to install a compatible version. The React Native documentation provides instructions on how to do this.

### Solution: Updating Java Version

To update your Java version, you can use a version manager like `jenv` or `sdkman`. These tools make it easy to switch between different Java versions.

Here's an example of how to use `sdkman` to install a specific Java version:

```bash
sdk install java 8.0.272.hs-adpt
```

In this example, `sdk` installs version `8.0.272.hs-adpt` of Java.

### Conclusion

Understanding and troubleshooting build failures in React Native Android can be complex, especially with the constant updates and changes in the ecosystem. However, by understanding the common mistakes and their solutions, you can effectively resolve these issues and continue building amazing apps with React Native.

React Native is an open-source mobile application framework developed by Facebook, Inc. It allows developers to use React along with native platform capabilities. However, with the release of **React Native version 0.71.0-rc.0**, many developers have reported issues with the Android build failure. In this blog post, we will dive deep into the problem and provide a step-by-step solution to resolve this issue.

## The Problem

The *error* usually occurs when you are trying to run the `react-native run-android` command in the terminal. The error message displayed is usually something like this:

```javascript
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugManifest'.
> Manifest merger failed : Attribute application@appComponentFactory value=(androidx.core.app.CoreComponentFactory) from [androidx.core:core:1.0.0] AndroidManifest.xml:22:18-91
    is also present at [com.android.support:support-compat:28.0.0] AndroidManifest.xml:22:18-91 value=(android.support.v4.app.CoreComponentFactory).
    Suggestion: add 'tools:replace="android:appComponentFactory"' to <application> element at AndroidManifest.xml:7:5-117 to override.
```

The error message suggests that there is a conflict between the `androidx.core` and `com.android.support` libraries. This is a common issue when migrating from the old `com.android.support` library to the new `androidx.core` library.

## The Solution

The solution to this problem is to migrate your project to AndroidX. AndroidX is a major improvement to the original Android Support Library, which is no longer maintained. 

To migrate your project to AndroidX, follow these steps:

**Step 1:** First, you need to make sure that you have the latest version of the Android plugin for Gradle. Open your `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file and make sure that the distributionUrl is set to the latest version. It should look something like this:

```typescript
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-5.6.4-all.zip
```

**Step 2:** Next, you need to update your `android/build.gradle` file. Make sure that the `com.android.tools.build:gradle` is set to version 3.3.1 or later and that the `com.google.gms:google-services` is set to version 4.2.0 or later. It should look like this:

```typescript
buildscript {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath('com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.3.1')
        classpath('com.google.gms:google-services:4.2.0')
    }
}
```

**Step 3:** Now, you need to update your `android/app/build.gradle` file. Add the following lines to the `defaultConfig` section:

```typescript
defaultConfig {
    ...
    multiDexEnabled true
}
```

And add the following line to the `dependencies` section:

```typescript
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'androidx.multidex:multidex:2.0.1'
}
```

**Step 4:** The last step is to migrate your code to AndroidX. You can do this manually by replacing all the old `com.android.support` imports with the equivalent `androidx.core` imports. However, this can be a tedious process, especially for large projects. Fortunately, Android Studio provides a built-in tool to automate this process. To use this tool, go to `Refactor > Migrate to AndroidX` in the Android Studio menu.

After following these steps, your project should now be migrated to AndroidX, and the Android build failure should be resolved.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we have discussed a common issue that many developers face when working with React Native, specifically the Android build failure following the release of version 0.71.0-rc.0. We have explained the cause of this issue and provided a step-by-step solution to resolve it. By following these steps, you should be able to resolve this issue and continue developing your React Native apps without any problems. Happy coding!
