OpenAPI-Generator is a powerful tool that allows developers to generate server stubs, client SDKs, and API documentation directly from an OpenAPI Specification. However, due to certain configurations, you may encounter StackOverflow errors. This article aims to provide a solution to these errors by configuring OpenAPI-Generator to utilize the Jakarta package during generation.

## Common Mistakes Leading to StackOverflow Errors

**1. Incorrect Package Configuration:** One of the most common mistakes is incorrect package configuration. This usually happens when the OpenAPI-Generator is not correctly configured to utilize the Jakarta package during generation.

**2. Infinite Recursive Calls:** Another common mistake is infinite recursive calls. This happens when there is a loop in the call stack, and the program keeps calling the same function, leading to a StackOverflow error.

## Understanding the Error

Before we delve into the solution, let's understand the error with a simple example. Consider the following TypeScript code:

```typescript
function recursiveFunction() {
    recursiveFunction();
}
recursiveFunction();
```

In the above code, `recursiveFunction()` is a function that calls itself. When this function is called, it will keep calling itself infinitely, leading to a StackOverflow error. This is an example of an infinite recursive call, one of the common mistakes leading to StackOverflow errors.

## Configuring OpenAPI-Generator

Now, let's move on to the solution. To utilize the Jakarta package during generation, you need to correctly configure the OpenAPI-Generator. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
const openApiGenerator = require('openapi-generator-cli');

openApiGenerator.generate({
    inputSpec: 'https://myapi.com/openapi.json',
    generatorName: 'java',
    outputDir: './generated',
    additionalProperties: {
        'library': 'jakarta'
    }
});
```

In the above JavaScript code, we are using the `generate()` function of the `openapi-generator-cli` module to generate the server stubs, client SDKs, and API documentation. The `inputSpec` property is the URL of the OpenAPI Specification. The `generatorName` property is the name of the generator, in this case, 'java'. The `outputDir` property is the directory where the generated files will be saved.

The `additionalProperties` property is an object that contains additional properties that will be passed to the generator. In this case, we are passing the 'library' property with the value 'jakarta', which means that the OpenAPI-Generator will utilize the Jakarta package during generation.

## Understanding the Configuration

The configuration above may seem straightforward, but let's break it down further to understand it better. 

The `inputSpec` is the URL of the OpenAPI Specification. This is the source from which the OpenAPI-Generator generates the server stubs, client SDKs, and API documentation. 

The `generatorName` is the name of the generator. OpenAPI-Generator supports many generators, such as 'java', 'python', 'php', etc. In this case, we are using the 'java' generator.

The `outputDir` is the directory where the generated files will be saved. This directory must exist before running the generator. If it doesn't exist, the generator will throw an error.

The `additionalProperties` are properties that will be passed to the generator. These properties can be used to customize the generation process. In this case, we are passing the 'library' property with the value 'jakarta', which instructs the OpenAPI-Generator to utilize the Jakarta package during generation.

## The Importance of the Jakarta Package

The Jakarta package is a set of APIs for developing Java applications. It includes APIs for various tasks, such as database access, messaging, web services, etc. By utilizing the Jakarta package during generation, we can leverage these APIs and avoid the StackOverflow errors caused by incorrect package configuration or infinite recursive calls.

## Code Explanation

Now that we have a better understanding of the configuration and the importance of the Jakarta package, let's revisit the JavaScript code and explain it in more detail:

```javascript
const openApiGenerator = require('openapi-generator-cli');

openApiGenerator.generate({
    inputSpec: 'https://myapi.com/openapi.json',
    generatorName: 'java',
    outputDir: './generated',
    additionalProperties: {
        'library': 'jakarta'
    }
});
```

In the first line, we are requiring the `openapi-generator-cli` module. This module provides a command-line interface for the OpenAPI-Generator.

In the next line, we are calling the `generate()` function of the `openapi-generator-cli` module. This function generates the server stubs, client SDKs, and API documentation from the OpenAPI Specification.

The `generate()` function takes an object as an argument. This object contains the configuration for the generation process. 

The `inputSpec` property is the URL of the OpenAPI Specification. The `generatorName` property is the name of the generator. The `outputDir` property is the directory where the generated files will be saved.

The `additionalProperties` property is an object that contains additional properties that will be passed to the generator. The 'library' property with the value 'jakarta' instructs the OpenAPI-Generator to utilize the Jakarta package during generation.

By correctly configuring the OpenAPI-Generator and utilizing the Jakarta package during generation, you can avoid the StackOverflow errors and generate the server stubs, client SDKs, and API documentation successfully.

StackOverflow errors are a common issue for developers. These errors occur when a program's call stack pointer exceeds the stack bound. This is often due to a recursive function call. In this post, we'll look at how to configure the OpenAPI-Generator to utilize the Jakarta package during generation, which can help avoid these errors. 

## Step 1: Install the Necessary Packages

First, make sure that you have the necessary packages installed. This includes **OpenAPI-Generator** and the **Jakarta package**. You can install these using npm (Node Package Manager). 

```javascript
npm install @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli -g
npm install jakarta
```

In this code, the `-g` flag is used to install the OpenAPI-Generator globally, making it accessible from any directory on your machine. 

## Step 2: Configure OpenAPI-Generator

Next, you'll need to configure OpenAPI-Generator to use the Jakarta package. This can be done by adding a configuration file to your project. 

```javascript
const config = {
    generatorName: 'jakarta',
    outputDir: './output',
    glob: './spec/**/*.json',
    additionalProperties: {
        'apiPackage': 'com.example',
        'modelPackage': 'com.example.model',
        'invokerPackage': 'com.example.invoker',
    }
};
```

In this configuration file, we're specifying that we want to use the 'jakarta' generator, and we're setting the output directory to './output'. We're also setting the 'glob' property to './spec/**/*.json', which tells the generator where to find our JSON specification files. 

## Step 3: Generate the API

Now that we have our configuration file set up, we can generate our API. 

```javascript
const openApiGenerator = require('@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli');
openApiGenerator.generate(config);
```

In this code, we're importing the OpenAPI-Generator package and calling its `generate` function with our configuration object. 

## Step 4: Handle StackOverflow Errors

If you've followed the steps above and are still encountering StackOverflow errors, there are a few things you can try. 

First, make sure that your JSON specification files are not causing recursive function calls. This is a common cause of StackOverflow errors. 

Second, try increasing the stack size. You can do this by adding the `-Xss` option when starting your program. 

```javascript
java -Xss4m -jar openapi-generator-cli.jar generate ...
```

In this code, we're starting our program with a stack size of 4 megabytes. 

## Step 5: Test Your API

Finally, make sure to test your API thoroughly. This will help you catch any remaining issues and ensure that your API is working as expected. 

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');
axios.get('http://localhost:3000/api')
    .then(response => console.log(response.data))
    .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

In this code, we're using the axios package to send a GET request to our API, and we're logging the response. 

By following these steps, you should be able to configure OpenAPI-Generator to utilize the Jakarta package during generation and avoid StackOverflow errors. Remember, the key is to ensure that your JSON specification files are not causing recursive function calls, and to increase the stack size if necessary. Happy coding!
